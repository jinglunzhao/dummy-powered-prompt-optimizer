Proposed Assessment System V2 - Hybrid Deterministic + LLM Approach

This system achieves:
1. Consistency: Same dummy + same conversation = same score
2. Positive Response: Positive conversation ‚Üí improved score  
3. Negative Response: Negative conversation ‚Üí reduced score
4. Baseline Stability: No conversation = stable baseline score
