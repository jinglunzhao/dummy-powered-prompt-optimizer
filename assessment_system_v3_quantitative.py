Assessment System V3 - Quantitative Conversation Effectiveness Measurement

This system measures the quantitative impact of conversation on dummy's social skills:
1. Consistency: Same dummy + same conversation = same score
2. Quantitative Response: Conversation effectiveness ‚Üí proportional score change
3. Effectiveness Measurement: Measures HOW MUCH the conversation helped/hurt
4. Baseline Stability: No conversation = stable baseline score
