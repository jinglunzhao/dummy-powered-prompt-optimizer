# Assessment System Invariance Analysis

## üîç **Test Results: System IS Responsive But Shows Bias**

**Test Date**: September 25, 2025  
**Test Type**: Conversation Content Responsiveness  
**Dummy**: Test Dummy (balanced personality, all traits = 5/10)

## üìä **Results Summary**

| Scenario | Score | Change | Response |
|----------|-------|--------|----------|
| **Pre-assessment** | 2.25 | - | Baseline |
| **Positive conversation** | 2.20 | -0.05 | ‚ùå Declined |
| **Negative conversation** | 2.00 | -0.25 | ‚ùå Declined more |
| **Neutral conversation** | 2.15 | -0.10 | ‚ùå Declined |

## üö® **Critical Findings**

### **‚úÖ System IS Responsive**
- **Maximum change**: 0.25 (responsive threshold met)
- **Different responses**: Each conversation type produced different scores
- **Conversation impact**: System does respond to conversation content

### **‚ùå System Shows Decline Bias**
- **All post-assessments lower** than pre-assessment
- **Even positive conversation** caused decline (-0.05)
- **Negative conversation** caused largest decline (-0.25)
- **Neutral conversation** also caused decline (-0.10)

## üîç **Root Cause Analysis**

### **1. Previous Assessment Grounding Problem**
The system provides previous assessment results as a "reference point":
```
PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT RESULTS:
Previous average score: 2.25
Previous responses:
- Question: 2/4 (confidence: 3)
Use this as a reference point for your current assessment.
```

**This creates anchoring bias** - the dummy is anchored to the previous score and tends to rate lower.

### **2. Conversation Context Positioning**
Conversation context is added at the end of the prompt:
```
PERSONALITY TRAITS: [Dominant section]
SOCIAL ANXIETY: [Dominant section]
CHALLENGES: [Dominant section]
GOALS: [Dominant section]

ASSESSMENT QUESTION: [Question]

[Small conversation context at the end]
```

**The conversation context is weak** compared to dominant personality traits.

### **3. Temperature Too Low**
Temperature 0.2 makes responses too deterministic and conservative.

### **4. Prompt Structure Issues**
- **Personality dominates** the response
- **Conversation context is buried**
- **Previous assessment creates anchoring bias**
- **No explicit improvement encouragement**

## üí° **Improvement Ideas**

### **Idea 1: Restructure Prompt Priority**
```
CONVERSATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT:
Recent coaching session: [Conversation context - DOMINANT]

PERSONALITY BASELINE: [Personality traits - Supporting context]

ASSESSMENT QUESTION: [Question]

Based on your recent coaching experience, how has your confidence and self-perception changed?
```

### **Idea 2: Remove Previous Assessment Anchoring**
- **Remove** previous assessment reference
- **Focus** on conversation impact only
- **Let** conversation context drive the response

### **Idea 3: Increase Temperature**
- **Current**: 0.2 (too deterministic)
- **Proposed**: 0.5-0.7 (more responsive to context)
- **Benefit**: More variation based on conversation content

### **Idea 4: Add Explicit Improvement Instructions**
```
IMPORTANT: Consider how the coaching session has affected your confidence and self-perception. 
If the coaching was helpful and encouraging, you should feel more confident and rate yourself higher.
If the coaching was critical or discouraging, you might feel less confident and rate yourself lower.
```

### **Idea 5: Conversation-First Prompt Structure**
```
You are {dummy.name}. You just had a coaching session about your social skills.

COACHING SESSION SUMMARY:
{conversation_context}

YOUR PERSONALITY: [Brief personality summary]

ASSESSMENT QUESTION: {question}

Based on how the coaching session affected your confidence and self-perception, rate yourself...
```

### **Idea 6: Separate Pre/Post Assessment Logic**
- **Pre-assessment**: Focus on personality and baseline
- **Post-assessment**: Focus on conversation impact and change
- **Different prompts** for different assessment types

## üéØ **Recommended Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Quick Fixes**
1. **Remove previous assessment anchoring**
2. **Increase temperature to 0.5**
3. **Restructure prompt priority**

### **Phase 2: Advanced Improvements**
1. **Separate pre/post assessment prompts**
2. **Add explicit improvement instructions**
3. **Test with different conversation types**

### **Phase 3: Validation**
1. **Test with positive/negative/neutral conversations**
2. **Verify improvement responsiveness**
3. **Ensure consistency maintained**

## üìà **Expected Improvements**

### **With Quick Fixes**
- **Remove decline bias**
- **Show positive response to positive conversations**
- **Maintain consistency**
- **Better conversation impact measurement**

### **With Advanced Improvements**
- **Strong conversation responsiveness**
- **Realistic improvement patterns**
- **Valid social skills research**
- **Reliable experiment results**

## üèÜ **Conclusion**

**The assessment system IS responsive to conversation content, but shows a decline bias that makes it unsuitable for measuring conversation effectiveness.**

**Key Issues:**
1. ‚ùå Previous assessment anchoring bias
2. ‚ùå Conversation context too weak
3. ‚ùå Temperature too low
4. ‚ùå Prompt structure prioritizes personality over conversation

**Next Steps:**
1. ‚úÖ Implement quick fixes
2. ‚úÖ Test responsiveness improvement
3. ‚úÖ Validate conversation impact measurement
4. ‚úÖ Ready for reliable experiments
