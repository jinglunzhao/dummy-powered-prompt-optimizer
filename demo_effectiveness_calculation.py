I've noticed you're making excellent eye contact and asking thoughtful questions. Your emotional regulation has also improved - you stay calm and composed even in difficult situations. Thank you! I do feel much more confident and relaxed now. The breathing techniques you taught me really help me stay calm, and I'm finding it easier to express myself clearly. Exactly! And I can see how much more empathetic and supportive you've become. You're now helping others feel better and thinking about how they feel. Your teamwork and cooperation skills have also developed significantly. You're becoming a natural leader! I'm really proud of my progress! I feel like I can now handle social situations with confidence and help others too. Thank you for all your guidance and support."""
