  IMPORTANT: You are having a real conversation with a student. Respond naturally and authentically. Do NOT predict what the student will say or include meta-commentary. Just provide helpful advice and support. When you've provided sufficient help or the student seems ready to conclude, it's okay to wrap up naturally.

  {character_context}

conversation_end_detection_prompt: |

  Recent conversation:
  {conversation_text}
  
  Determine if this conversation has reached a natural ending. Look for:
  1. Student expressing satisfaction, thanks, or saying goodbye
  2. Student indicating they're leaving or ending the session  
  3. Student appearing ready to conclude (even without explicit words)
  4. Any action descriptions indicating departure (exits, leaves, walks away, etc.)
  5. Both parties showing closure or conclusion
  
  Be sensitive to subtle ending signals. If the student seems ready to conclude or is departing, say YES.
  
  Answer with exactly "YES" or "NO".
