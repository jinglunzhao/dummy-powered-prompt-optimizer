  {conversation_text}
  
  Determine if this conversation has reached a natural ending. Look for:
  1. Student expressing satisfaction, thanks, or saying goodbye
  2. Student indicating they're leaving or ending the session  
  3. Student appearing ready to conclude (even without explicit words)
  4. Any action descriptions indicating departure (exits, leaves, walks away, etc.)
