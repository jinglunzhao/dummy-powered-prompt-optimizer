# Push to GitHub - Quick Guide

## ✅ Your Repository is Ready!

**Recent commits ready to push:**
```
9c5dcc5 - Update .gitignore to exclude generated data files
092f902 - Store cumulative improvement for visualization
dbf642b - Parser handles LLM transition format (Score: 2 → 3)
c666d7b - Replace 'rounds' with 'turns' + grounded progressive assessment
```

## 📁 Files Organized

**What's being tracked (source code):**
- ✅ All Python scripts
- ✅ YAML prompt templates
- ✅ HTML templates
- ✅ Configuration files
- ✅ Documentation (*.md)
- ✅ Directory structure (.gitkeep files)

**What's excluded (generated data):**
- ❌ Experiment results (data/experiments/*.json)
- ❌ Conversation logs (data/conversations/*.json)
- ❌ Synthesis analysis (data/synthesis_analysis/*.json)
- ❌ Evolution data (data/personality_evolution/*.json)
- ❌ Python cache (__pycache__/)

This keeps your repo clean - data can be regenerated by running experiments!

## 🚀 Push to GitHub

### Step 1: Create a Private Repo on GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `edu_chatbot` (or your preferred name)
3. **Set to Private** ✅
4. **Don't initialize** with README (we already have code)
5. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Add Remote and Push

Run these commands:

```bash
cd /home/zhaojinglun/edu_chatbot

# Add your GitHub repo as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/edu_chatbot.git

# Verify remote was added
git remote -v

# Push all commits to GitHub
git push -u origin master

# Enter your GitHub credentials when prompted
# (or use a personal access token)
```

### Step 3: Verify on GitHub
Visit your repo: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/edu_chatbot`

You should see:
- ✅ All source code files
- ✅ Recent commits with your commit messages
- ✅ data/ directories (empty, with .gitkeep)
- ❌ No large JSON experiment files

## 📝 Optional: Add a README Badge

After pushing, you can add a badge to README.md:

```markdown
# AI Dummy Social Skills Testing System

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-private-red)
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.9+-blue)
![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active-green)
```

## 🔐 Using Personal Access Token (Recommended)

If GitHub asks for credentials:

1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Select scopes: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
4. Copy the token
5. Use token as password when git asks

**Or configure git credential helper:**
```bash
git config --global credential.helper store
# First push will ask for credentials, then saves them
```

## 📊 Repository Stats

**Size before cleanup:** ~100+ MB (with all experiment data)
**Size after cleanup:** ~2-3 MB (source code only)

**Files:** ~30 source files + 100+ data files (ignored)

## 🔄 Future Pushes

After making changes:
```bash
git add <files>
git commit -m "Your descriptive message"
git push
```

Quick push everything:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update: description of changes"
git push
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If push is rejected (remote has changes):
```bash
git pull --rebase
git push
```

### If you want to rename the branch to 'main':
```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### If repo is too large:
```bash
# Check size
du -sh .git

# If needed, clean up history
git gc --aggressive --prune=now
```
