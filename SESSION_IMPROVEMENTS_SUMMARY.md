# Session Improvements Summary
**Date:** 2025-10-18

This document summarizes all improvements made during this cleanup and refactoring session.

---

## 🎯 Major Achievements

### 1. ✅ Anxiety Level Convention Enforcement
**Changed from categorical strings to numeric values**

**Files Modified:**
- `models.py` - Changed `get_anxiety_category()` to return `int` instead of `str`
- `models.py` - Updated character summary to show numeric levels

**Impact:**
- Consistent 1-10 numeric scale across entire codebase
- No more confusing "low"/"moderate"/"high" categories
- Easier to track and compare anxiety levels

---

### 2. ✅ Complete Prompt Migration to YAML

**Migrated ALL hardcoded prompts to YAML files**

#### Prompts Migrated:
1. `config.py` - SYSTEM_PROMPT now loads from YAML
2. `test_gepa_system.py` - Initial prompt loads from YAML
3. `simple_conversation_mock.py` - Test prompt loads from YAML
4. `conversation_length_experiment_with_evolution.py` - Validated to require YAML
5. `prompt_optimizer.py` - `reflection_prompt` migrated from inline
6. `prompt_optimizer.py` - `synthesis_analysis_prompt` migrated from inline
7. `conversation_simulator.py` - Student opening instructions moved to YAML
8. `conversation_simulator.py` - Character context template extracted to YAML

**Results:**
- ✅ Zero hardcoded prompts
- ✅ Zero duplications
- ✅ 89% prompt usage rate (17/19)
- ✅ Full tracking capability

---

### 3. ✅ Cursor Rules Created

**Created 5 comprehensive cursor rules:**

1. **`project-overview.mdc`** (Always Applied)
   - System architecture
   - File organization
   - Testing philosophy
   - Prompt storage architecture

2. **`anxiety-level-conventions.mdc`**
   - Numeric-only values guideline
   - Examples and anti-patterns

3. **`models-structure.mdc`**
   - Complete data model hierarchy
   - Evolution system explained
   - Key conventions

4. **`personality-evolution.mdc`**
   - Evolution system details
   - Original vs current traits
   - Usage patterns

5. **`assessment-system.mdc`**
   - Assessment flow
   - Scoring conventions
   - Integration points

---

### 4. ✅ Prompt Tracking System

**Created automated tracking tools and documentation:**

#### Tools:
- `scripts/track_prompts.py` - Automated prompt usage analyzer
  - Scans all YAML files
  - Finds all `get_prompt()` calls
  - Detects hardcoded prompts
  - Identifies unused prompts

#### Documentation:
- `PROMPT_REFERENCE_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive 294-line reference
- `PROMPT_TRACKING_SUMMARY.md` - Quick at-a-glance summary
- `prompts/README.md` - Directory guide with examples
- `MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - Migration process documentation

**Usage:**
```bash
python scripts/track_prompts.py
```

---

### 5. ✅ Realistic Conversation Context

**Removed AI "mind reading" capability**

#### What Changed:

**Before:**
```python
# AI coach had full access to student's psychological profile
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Student Profile: [FULL PSYCHOLOGY PROFILE]"}
]
```

**After:**
```python
# AI coach only knows what student shares
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
    {"role": "user", "content": """
        You are meeting with Amy, a student seeking help.
        
        [Memo of what student shared - after 6+ rounds]
        
        Recent Conversation:
        Amy: [what they said]
        Assistant: [what you said]
        """}
]
```

**New System:**
- AI starts with only student's name
- Learns about student through conversation
- Generates memo after 12+ turns (6+ rounds)
- Memo summarizes what student explicitly shared
- Recent 6 turns always included for context

---

### 6. ✅ Fixed LLM Role Confusion

**Changed from multi-role to two-role system**

#### Before (Confusing):
```python
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "..."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Amy: message"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "response"},  # ❌ Mixing history with actual role
    {"role": "user", "content": "Amy: message2"}
]
```

#### After (Clear):
```python
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "..."},
    {"role": "user", "content": """
        Conversation History:
        Amy: message
        Assistant: response
        Amy: message2
        
        Provide your next response.
        """}
]
```

**Benefits:**
- Only 2 roles: system and user
- Conversation history embedded as transcript
- No confusion about who is speaking

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### 1. **Hidden Prompt Fragments**
Found prompts split between YAML and code:
- Student opening instructions appended in code
- Reflection/synthesis prompts hardcoded inline
- Character context as formatted strings

**Lesson:** Always check for f-string concatenation after loading prompts

### 2. **Role Confusion in LLMs**
Using "assistant" role for conversation history confused the model.

**Lesson:** Keep it simple - use only system and user roles, embed history as transcript

### 3. **Unrealistic Information Access**
AI coach had full access to student's psychological profile.

**Lesson:** Realistic scenarios produce better tests and more valid results

### 4. **Convention Enforcement**
Numeric values vs categorical strings were inconsistent.

**Lesson:** Document conventions and enforce them across the entire codebase

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional)

### Immediate Testing
- [ ] Run a test conversation to verify memo system works
- [ ] Check GEPA optimization still functions correctly
- [ ] Verify assessment system with new conversation context

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Investigate `fallback_summary_prompt` - still needed?
- [ ] Consider adding memo caching to avoid regeneration
- [ ] Add memo to conversation storage for analysis
- [ ] Create visualization of what AI knows vs what student knows

### Documentation Maintenance
- [ ] Update docs when adding new prompts
- [ ] Run `scripts/track_prompts.py` before major changes
- [ ] Keep cursor rules updated with new conventions
