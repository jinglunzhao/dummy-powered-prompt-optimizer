It's awesome that you're already taking initiative with public speaking through hackathons - that's a perfect way to combine your CS passion with skill-building. \n\nFor financial planning, let's tackle this step by step:\n1. Schedule an appointment with your school's financial aid office this week (they often have hidden resources)\n2. Try using a free budgeting app like Mint to track loans vs. income\n3. For grad school costs, research TA/RA positions - many programs offer tuition remission\n\nWant to grab coffee on campus this week?

Would you have 15 minutes for a quick chat about your experience?\"\n\n2) For interviews, practice with career services or record yourself answering common questions. Many tech companies actually value quiet, focused coders - emphasize your problem-solving skills.\n\n3) Look for remote or hybrid roles if in-person networking feels overwhelming.
