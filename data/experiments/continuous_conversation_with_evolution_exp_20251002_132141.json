They can help you understand repayment options and may know about loan forgiveness programs for CS grads.\n\n2) Career path: Since you're comfortable presenting, leverage that strength! Look for research assistant positions where you can both code and present findings - great prep for grad school.\n\n3) Next steps this week:\n- Schedule financial aid appointment\n- Ask 1 professor about research opportunities\n- Attend grad school info session\n\nYour presentation skills are actually a huge asset in tech - many engineers struggle with that",

Would you have 15 minutes to chat about how undergrads might contribute?\"\n\n2) For info sessions: Go with a friend or set a simple goal like \"I'll ask one thoughtful question.\" Remember, most people are focused on their own nerves!\n\n3) Your coding skills: Frame it as eagerness to learn rather than perfection.

Solutions offered: Scripted professor outreach strategy, loan counseling referral, and reframing failure as growth material. Gregory immediately implemented the email approach tactic, demonstrating progress through proactive behavior (sent customized request to Professor Chen) and cognitive shift (using humor to neutralize rejection fears). Concrete evidence: Email dispatched despite prior anxiety, with growth mindset framing potential failure as essay-worthy learning.",
