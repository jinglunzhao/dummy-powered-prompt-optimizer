Is it delegating tasks, leading meetings, or recruiting members?\n\nSince you're conscientious, use that strength! Create a simple roadmap: define your org's mission, identify 2-3 potential members this week, and schedule a casual first meeting. Your low social anxiety is a huge asset here—use it to make those initial connections. What's one small step you could take today?",
