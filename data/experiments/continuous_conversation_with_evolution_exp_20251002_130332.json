Most alumni love helping students!  \n2) **Loans**: Check if your university has a financial literacy workshop (many do!). Also look into income-driven repayment plans.  \n3) **Public Speaking**: Your volunteer work is perfect practice! Ask if you can lead a small session to build confidence.  \n\nFor large lectures, arrive early to chat with nearby students - makes it feel less intimidating. You've got this!  \n\nWant to brainstorm specific grad programs this week? I can share some resources.",
