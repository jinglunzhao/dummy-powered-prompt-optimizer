Solutions offered: a) Graduated exposure to public speaking (recordings → study group → workshop observation → 2-min practice), b) Career comparison exercise, c) Income-driven repayment plans, and d) Math study buddy. Gregory responded positively by: scheduling practice time, revealing workshop awareness, articulating career preferences clearly, and accepting breathing techniques. Progress evidenced through concrete commitments: booked 3:15pm practice session, agreed to observe workshop, and initiated career clarity exercise.",
