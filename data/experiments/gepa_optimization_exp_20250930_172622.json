Since you're already proactive and open, let's channel that energy into small, consistent steps. \n\nFor grad apps: start by identifying one professor in your CS niche whose work excites you—maybe someone in AI or systems. Reach out briefly to ask about their research; your curiosity will naturally shine.\n\nFor presentations: reframe them as chances to share your passion, not perform. Practice explaining your project to a friend first—it’ll build confidence and make large lectures feel more conversational.\n\nYou've got the drive; just break it down into manageable pieces.
