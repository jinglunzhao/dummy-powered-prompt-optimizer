Practicing while he's distracted could be perfect—it mimics real lecture hall energy (some people zoning out, multitasking) without intense scrutiny. \n\nJust don't take it personally if he asks \"Wait, what was that about Dijkstra's algorithm?\" while respawning. That's actually useful feedback—it means you need to make key points clearer! \n\nWant to try it this week and see how it goes?",
