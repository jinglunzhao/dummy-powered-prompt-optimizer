Alex ACCEPTED all: planning the tour, scheduling focused app work, committing to show his charcoal piece, initiating a time management coffee session, and starting budget tracking using an art-themed system. 3) Student's Response: Alex shifted visibly from shaky voice and anxiety (checking watch, fidgeting) to genuine smiles, relaxed posture, confident strides, proactive planning (scheduling, reminders), and using humor to engage with challenges (blaming artists for spending). He directly adopted the coach's mantras and initiated next steps. 4) Evidence of Progress: Key improvements include vulnerability in sharing art, proactive scheduling (coffee, reminders), starting financial tracking despite dread, reframing overwhelm into manageable steps (gallery tour vs. club), and embodying a 'progress over perfection' mindset through verbal affirmations and physical relaxation.",

That's excitement in disguise').",

Secondary challenges included starting studying, participating in Q&A, and feeling isolated. 2) **Solutions Offered/Accepted:** The coach offered micro-steps (recording intro only, 20-second timers), cognitive reframing (viewing recordings as feedback, normalizing anxiety), and environmental strategies (door seat, lucky notebook, written questions). Sarah accepted and implemented: recording practice, using grounding techniques (counting tiles), starting studying via micro-timers, planning Q&A participation with a written question, and requesting a Wednesday check-in. 3) **Student's Response:** Sarah responded positively to strength-based framing ('math brain FTW'), humor ('baby turtle'), and tangible tools (tracker, playlist, doodles). She showed increased self-efficacy ('I can do this. Maybe') and trust ('less alone maybe?'). 4) **Evidence of Progress:** Sarah completed the feared recording session ('I did it'), used coping strategies effectively during lecture ('not as bad as I thought'), initiated studying ('solved equation'), planned concrete social action ('write down one question'), requested support ('check in Wednesday'), and demonstrated reduced self-judgment (accepting 'silly' strategies as 'brilliant').",

Concrete solutions included scheduling a roommate meeting via text, drafting an elevator pitch, implementing block scheduling, signing up for financial workshops, and planning low-stakes speaking practice. Zachary responded proactively by immediately texting his roommate, blocking study time, signing up for workshops, and scheduling practice sessions. Evidence of progress includes raising his hand in class, preparing lab materials the night before, using humor about anxieties, and consistently implementing sleep hygiene improvements like phone distancing and hydration routines.",
