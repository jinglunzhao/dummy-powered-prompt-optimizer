The more familiar you are with what you're saying, the less room there is for anxiety to creep in.\n\n3. **Use Visualization**: Before a big talk, visualize yourself succeeding—imagine the audience engaged and responding positively.

However, the advice could have probed deeper into the root of his fear (e.g., a past experience) to personalize the solution further. Key insight: For highly extraverted but anxious students, combine immediate coping techniques with exploring the underlying narrative to build lasting confidence."

The key is to channel that energy into something productive. Here are a few practical tips that have helped me and others:\n\n1. **Practice, but not just alone.** Rehearse your presentation out loud, ideally in front of a friend or even record yourself. This builds muscle memory so even if your mind goes blank, your mouth might keep going. Plus, getting feedback from someone you trust can ease anxiety.\n\n2. **Focus on your breathing.** When you start to panic, your breathing gets shallow, which makes everything worse.

The more familiar you are with what you're saying, the less room there is for anxiety to creep in.\n\n3. **Use Visualization**: Before a big talk, visualize yourself succeeding—imagine the audience engaged and responding positively.

The key is to channel that energy into something productive. Here are a few practical tips that have helped me and others:\n\n1. **Practice, but not just alone.** Rehearse your presentation out loud, ideally in front of a friend or even record yourself. This builds muscle memory so even if your mind goes blank, your mouth might keep going. Plus, getting feedback from someone you trust can ease anxiety.\n\n2. **Focus on your breathing.** When you start to panic, your breathing gets shallow, which makes everything worse.

Instead of thinking, “They’re judging me,” try shifting to, “They’re here to learn, just like me.” Your voice shaking is just your body’s way of saying you care, and that’s a strength.\n\nHere’s a practical step: next lecture, pick one person in the middle or back rows and pretend you’re just explaining the concept to them.
