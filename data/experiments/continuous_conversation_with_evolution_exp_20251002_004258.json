Here's a quick action plan:\n\n1) Register for that workshop now (committing helps)\n2) Watch the recording in your comfiest study spot\n3) Jot down 2-3 specific questions as you watch\n4) Email the instructor within 24 hours while it's fresh\n\nPro tip: Frame your email like: \"I really appreciated when you explained X - could you clarify how this applies to Y situation?\" This shows you're engaged without feeling like you're \"bothering\" them. \n\nYou're already thinking strategically about this - that's half the battle!

Here's a streamlined version of your system:\n\n1) **Work Sessions**:\n- 25 min focused coding (Mittens supervises)\n- 5 min play break (her choice of toy)\n- After 3 cycles, take a proper break together\n\n2) **Problem Solving**:\n1. Rubber duck debugging with Mittens\n2. If stuck, take a short walk\n3. Return with fresh eyes\n\n3) **Rewards**:\n- You: Track small coding wins\n- Mittens: Treats for good behavior\n- Celebrate progress together\n\nRemember: Even small steps forward count! Mittens would be proud of your progress.",
