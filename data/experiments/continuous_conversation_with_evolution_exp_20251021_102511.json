Try shifting your attention to the other person—really listen to what they're saying rather than rehearsing your response. If you do blank, it's okay to say, \"Let me think about that for a second\"—people respect pauses more than we realize.\n\nWant to try this week's challenge? In your next study group: \n1. Use the breathing trick before speaking \n2. Aim for one genuine question or comment (even \"Can you explain that part again?\" counts) \n3.

Wanting to start an organization is awesome, and it’s totally normal to feel nervous about the social side of it.

For example, you could start by chatting with classmates before or after lectures—just simple stuff like, \"How’d you find that assignment?\" or \"Are you going to the event this week?\" This builds confidence for bigger interactions.  \n\nFor the organization, maybe begin by recruiting one or two close friends or classmates you’re comfortable with.

And if there’s a pause? That’s okay! A short silence isn’t as noticeable as we think. You can always have a backup question ready, like \"How’s your semester going so far?\"  \n\nAnother tip: **active listening**. Nod, say \"Yeah\" or \"That’s interesting,\" and occasionally reflect back what they say (\"Oh, you’re into hiking? I’ve never been, but it sounds cool!\").

That’s not about you—they might just be tired or distracted.  \n\nYou could also sprinkle in **light personal reactions** to make it feel more natural, like:  \n- \"I totally missed that detail until you mentioned it—now I want to reread that section!\"  \n- \"Oh cool, I’ve never studied that artist much—what do you like about their work?\"  \n\nYou’re already thinking strategically about this, which is a great sign.

The good news is that presentation and networking skills can absolutely be improved with practice and some simple strategies. \n\nLet's break this down into manageable pieces. First, with presentations - do you think your mind goes blank more from lack of preparation or from anxiety in the moment? For networking, what specific situations make you most nervous - is it approaching people, keeping conversations going, or something else?\n\nA technique that helps many students is the \"3-second rule\" - when you feel yourself freezing, just take three slow breaths before responding. It gives your brain time to reset. Would you be open to trying some small practice exercises together? We could start with something low-pressure, like introducing yourself to me as if we just met at a networking event.",

For networking, it's definitely approaching people that's hardest - like I'll see someone I should talk to at an event and just freeze up. \n\nThe breathing trick sounds simple enough to try. And yeah, practicing introductions would be good... though even this is making me a little nervous to be honest. Could we maybe start with just writing down what I'd say first?

Remember, in real situations you can always modify it - this is just to give you a solid foundation to start from. \n\nFor the presentation anxiety, when you prepare, do you practice out loud at all?

Prepare thoroughly: For presentations, over-prepare your material until you know it backwards. Practice out loud alone first, then with a trusted friend. Recording yourself can help too—you'll likely realize you sound more confident than you feel.\n\n3. Reframe nervous energy: That adrenaline rush isn't necessarily bad—it's your body preparing to perform.

These are low-risk but get you comfortable speaking up.\n\nAbout your voice recordings - that cringe feeling is completely normal at first! Almost everyone dislikes hearing their recorded voice initially. Try this: record just 30 seconds of yourself talking about your day, then listen once and delete it. The more you do this, the more normal it will feel.\n\nFor group projects, preparing talking points is brilliant. Also consider:\n1. Arrive early to chat casually with teammates before the \"work\" begins\n2. Write down your main ideas before speaking (this gives you a safety net)\n3. Remember that everyone is focused on their own contributions, not judging yours\n\nWould you like to practice crafting some sample discussion contributions or group project talking points together?

If you blank, you can casually glance at it like you're remembering something (\"Oh!

Law school is challenging enough without adding social anxiety into the mix, so I'm glad you're taking steps to work on this.\n\nLet's break this down. When you say you struggle with meeting people in classes and talking to professors, what specifically feels hardest for you? Is it starting conversations, keeping them going, or something else? \n\nFor classmates, one low-pressure way to start is with simple \"contextual\" conversations—commenting on something relevant like a tough assignment (\"That reading was intense—how are you handling it?\") or asking for clarification after class (\"Hey, I wasn't clear on what the professor said about X—did you catch that?\"). These give you natural exit points if you feel overwhelmed.\n\nWith professors, many students feel intimidated! Try preparing one specific question beforehand for office hours—it gives you structure. Most professors appreciate students who show up prepared. \n\nWould any of these approaches feel manageable to try this week? We can practice them right now if you'd like.",
