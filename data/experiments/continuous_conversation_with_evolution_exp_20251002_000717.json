Would you have 15 minutes to share your experience?\" Most people love helping students!\n\n2) For time management: Try the Pomodoro technique - 25 mins focused work, 5 min break. Even just 2 Pomodoros on your assignment today will help.\n\nRemember, progress > perfection. Which of these steps feels most doable to start with",

Many love when proactive students show interest.\n\n3) For stress: Block out 15-minute breaks between study sessions to recharge. Even a quick walk helps.\n\nWant to grab coffee after your TA hours?
