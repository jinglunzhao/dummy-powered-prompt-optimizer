For public speaking, start small: practice your presentations in front of a mirror or record yourself. It builds confidence gradually.\n\nYour fear of choosing the \"wrong\" career path is common. Remember, it’s not a final decision—many people pivot. Focus on skills you enjoy building now; they’ll serve you no matter where you land.\n\nYou’ve got this!
