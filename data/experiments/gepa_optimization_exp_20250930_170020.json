Your worries about grad school and public speaking might really be about feeling \"seen\" and making the *right* impression, right? What if we start small: practice speaking in study groups to build confidence in a low-pressure setting. And for grad apps, maybe reach out to a professor you vibe with—it makes the path feel less lonely. You’ve got this. What part feels most urgent to tackle first?",
