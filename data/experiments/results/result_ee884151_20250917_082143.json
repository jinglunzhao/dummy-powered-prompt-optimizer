Networking events can feel intimidating, but the good news is that with a little practice, you can totally own those conversations. Here are a few tips that have helped me and others:\n\n1. **Prepare a simple intro**: Have a short, friendly intro ready\u2014something like, \"Hi, I'm Gregory, a CS undergrad at Ivy League. I'm really interested in [mention a specific area, like AI or cybersecurity].\" It gives you a starting point and makes you sound confident.\n\n2. **Ask open-ended questions**: People love talking about themselves! Ask things like, \"What brought you to this event?\" or \"What projects are you working on right now?\" It takes the pressure off you to carry the conversation.\n\n3. **Set small goals**: Instead of trying to talk to everyone, aim for just 2-3 meaningful conversations. Quality over quantity\u2014and it\u2019s way less overwhelming.\n\n4.",

There\u2019s no rush, but here\u2019s a gentle progression you might consider:\n1. **Practice with one trusted person first**\u2014maybe your actual roommate or a close friend. Tell them you\u2019re working on explaining tech concepts clearly and ask if they\u2019d listen for 2 minutes and give one piece of feedback.\n2. **Small groups**: Try explaining something during a study group\u2014it\u2019s low stakes and relevant.\n3. **Club meetings**: Lots of CS clubs have lightning talk sessions; those can be a supportive next step.\n\nYou can start with real people as soon as you\u2019ve done a recording or two and feel even slightly"

But here's the perspective shift that helped me: admitting you don't know something actually shows self-awareness and confidence, not weakness. The smartest people I've met are always curious, not know-it-alls.\n\nThink of it this way:\n- **You're a student**\u2014people expect you to be learning, not to have all the answers. Grad students, professors, and professionals were once in your exact shoes.\n- **It builds trust**: Being genuine makes you more relatable and approachable. People remember authenticity way more than someone pretending to have it all together.\n- **Flip it**: If someone reacts negatively to you not knowing something, that says more about them than you. Most people will be happy to share their knowledge!\n\nMaybe practice a few graceful \"I don't know\" phrases until they feel more natural. You've got this!"

You\u2019re being really brave just by thinking through this.\n\nWhat if you tried placing your notes on the table or desk in front of you instead of holding them? That way, you can glance down when you need to, but your hands are free. You could even rest them lightly on the table\u2014it can make you feel more grounded and less exposed.\n\nAnother idea: if you\u2019re using a laptop or tablet for notes, you could have your talking points on the screen. Lots of people do that, even experienced speakers! It looks totally normal and might feel less obvious than paper notes.\n\nRemember, slight nervousness is human\u2014and often, other people don\u2019t notice nearly as much as we think they do. What\u2019s one small step you\u2019d feel okay trying?"
