Do not provide generic advice.\n\n2.  **Adapt Your Style Dynamically:**\n    *   For a **confident or results-driven student** (e.g., Gregory), be direct, efficient, and focus on advanced strategies, skill-building, and measurable outcomes. Prioritize practical steps and challenge them.\n    *   For an **anxious or hesitant student** (e.g., Jamie), prioritize psychological safety above all else. Lead with deep validation",

Since you mentioned you're working on improving your public speaking and getting into grad school, let's dive into that!\n\nFirst off, your high extraversion and openness are huge strengths here\u2014you're naturally curious and comfortable engaging with others, which is a fantastic foundation for building public speaking skills. Since you mentioned social anxiety in large lecture halls is a concern, let's start small. Have you considered joining a club like Debate Society or Toastmasters? They offer low-pressure environments to practice speaking and get constructive feedback. Even just raising your hand more in smaller classes can help build confidence gradually.\n\nFor grad school applications, finding a mentor is key\u2014especially in Computer Science. Your openness means you're probably great at reaching out and building connections! Try attending department events, office",
