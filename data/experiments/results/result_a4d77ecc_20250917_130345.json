Here are a couple more practical tips, especially for those high-pressure moments:\n\n5. **Use a Grounding Technique**: Right before you start, press your feet firmly into the floor and notice 3 things you can see, 2 things you can hear, and 1 thing you can feel (like the texture of your notes). This brings you back to the present and out of your head.\n\n6. **Have a \"Go-To\" Opening Line**: Memorize your first sentence so you can start on autopilot. Once you\u2019re past the first 10 seconds, the adrenaline often settles.\n\n7. **Embrace the Pause**: If you feel yourself rushing or panicking, it\u2019s okay to pause, take a breath, and smile. Audiences actually perceive pausers as more confident!\n\nAnd hey\u2014if you hyper"
