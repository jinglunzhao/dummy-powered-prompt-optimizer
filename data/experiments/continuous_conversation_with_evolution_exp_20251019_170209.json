Let's tackle these one at a time so it feels manageable, starting with what's feeling most urgent to you right now. \n\nFor the networking/presentation anxiety: This is super common, especially in academic settings where the stakes feel high. Here’s a practical approach we can try:\n1. **Reframe \"networking\" as \"learning\"**: Instead of pressuring yourself to impress people, focus on asking questions like, \"What’s a project you’re excited about?\" This shifts the pressure off you. \n2. **Practice with low-risk scenarios**: Attend smaller department events first (like a guest lecture Q&A) where you can practice speaking up in shorter bursts. \n3. **Physical prep**: For sweating/shaking, try grounding techniques beforehand—square breathing (4 sec inhale, 4",

Like how am I supposed to focus on networking when I'm calculating interest rates in my head during conversations?\" \n\n(Abruptly changes tone) \"Wait—should I be practicing my elevator pitch on my roommate when he steals my coffee?

No counting needed.  \n\nNow, about the money stress—that's completely valid. Financial anxiety hijacks our focus like nothing else. Two quick things we can do:  \n1. **Compartmentalize**: Give yourself 10 dedicated minutes *before* events to check accounts/budget, so your brain knows money's been addressed.  \n2. **Conversation pivot**: If your mind drifts mid-chat, use it as fuel—\"Actually, I've been researching financial literacy resources. Have you found any good ones?\" Turns stress into connection.  \n\n(Leans in conspiratorially)",

Solutions offered included reframing networking as learning, using grounding techniques for presentations, compartmentalizing financial stress, and scripting for roommate issues. Gregory responded positively, accepting the reframing idea, agreeing to try the presentation toolkit, acknowledging the financial strategy, and showing willingness to address the roommate issue. Evidence of progress includes his plan to use the reframing technique, implement the emergency toolkit, and workshop a script for his roommate.",

I completely understand how overwhelming social situations like interviews and networking can feel, especially when you're just starting out. \n\nLet's break this down into manageable pieces. What specifically makes you most nervous about these situations? Is it the fear of saying the wrong thing, not knowing what to talk about, or something else? Understanding your specific concerns will help us create a targeted plan.\n\nFor now, here are a few quick starting points that might help:\n1. **Practice with low-stakes interactions** - Try making small talk with cashiers or baristas to build comfort with casual conversations\n2. **Prepare talking points** - For interviews/networking, jot down 3-5 key things you'd want to share about yourself\n3. **The 3-second rule** - When meeting someone new, make yourself smile and say",

Try simple scripts like:\n     *\"Busy day today?\"* (weather comment)  \n     *\"I'll try the [item]—have you had it?\"*  \n   - Even if your voice shakes, that's a win.

Say *\"That's an interesting question...\"* while looking at your shoes and mumbling.  \n2. Now say it while making brief eye contact, with a slight thoughtful nod.  \n\nHear/feel the difference? The second version reads as confident and engaged—even though it's the same words.  \n\nFor practicing with friends: Start by telling them *\"I'm working on handling unexpected questions—can we try some light roleplay?\"* Most people are happy to help, especially if they know it's practice.
