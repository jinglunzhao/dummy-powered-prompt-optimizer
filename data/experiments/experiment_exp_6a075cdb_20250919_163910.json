This can help calm your nervous system and give you a second to collect your thoughts. It’s subtle, but it works wonders.\n\n### 2. **Keep It Simple with One or Two Questions**\nInstead of trying to remember a whole list, just pick one or two questions you feel most comfortable with and make those your go-tos. For example:\n- “What’s your favorite piece here?”\n- “Have you been to any other shows lately?”\n\nYou can even write them on your phone or a small notecard to glance at discreetly if you need a quick reminder.\n\n###",

          "The mentor excelled at pivoting from a rejected technique (breathing) to a better-fit alternative (power pose), effectively leveraging Gregory's competitive drive. The initial suggestion of box breathing was a misstep, failing to account for his high extraversion and dislike of passive exercises. Key insight: For highly extraverted students, focus on active, energy-channeling techniques and competitive frameworks rather than introspective calming exercises."

Staying focused during lectures can be tough, especially when you're juggling a lot. Let's break this down into some practical steps you can try.\n\n1. **Prepare Beforehand**:  \n   - Skim the lecture material or readings *before* class. Even just 10 minutes can make a huge difference—it primes your brain to recognize key concepts, making it easier to follow along and stay engaged.\n\n2. **Active Note-Taking**:  \n   - Instead of writing down everything, try methods like the Cornell system or mind mapping. Focus on main ideas, questions, and summaries. This keeps your mind actively processing information rather than passively listening.\n\n3. **Minimize Distractions**:  \n   - Sit near the front of the class—it’s easier to focus when you’re closer to the professor. Also, consider putting your phone on silent or in",

Plus, it shows your professor you’re invested, which could be helpful for networking or future references (hello, dream internship!).\n\n2. **Break It Down Mentally**:  \n   If you feel your attention drifting, give yourself mini-goals.

However, suggesting deep breaths was unnecessary for his low anxiety; focusing solely on channeling his energy (e.g., the grounding stance) would have been more effective. For highly extraverted students, focus less on calming techniques and more on redirecting their natural energy into constructive habits."

The fact that you're reaching out for support shows how proactive and resilient you are, and I'm here to help you work through this step by step.\n\nLet's start by grounding for a moment—would you be open to trying a quick breathing exercise together? It's called box breathing: inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4. We can do it right now if you'd like—just follow my lead.\n\nOnce you feel a bit more centered, we can explore what specifically about social situations feels overwhelming. Is it large groups, making conversation, or maybe feeling pressure to be \"on\" all the time? Understanding your unique experience will help us come up with strategies that feel authentic and manageable for you.",

Many students are actually just as nervous or distracted as you might feel. Your comment or question could help clarify something for others, and it shows engagement—professors really appreciate that, especially if grad school is a goal!\n\nAlso, since you mentioned low social anxiety in general, lean into that strength. Maybe arrive a few minutes early to chat with someone sitting nearby—it can make the room feel friendlier and less intimidating when you speak up.\n\nWould you like to try role-playing a scenario, like asking a question in a large class? It can help build that muscle in a low-pressure way!",

Building a tool like that not only sharpens your coding skills but also directly addresses your public speaking goals—it’s a win-win.\n\nIf you want to take it even further, you could integrate something like sentiment analysis to gauge the tone of your speech, or even a simple visualization of your pacing. Projects like this are fantastic for your portfolio and show initiative—great for both grad applications and finding a mentor who values innovation.\n\nKeep me posted on your progress! And hey, if you hit any coding snags or want to brainstorm features, I’m here. You’re turning a challenge into an opportunity—that’s seriously impressive."

Even just 10 minutes can make a huge difference—it primes your brain to recognize key concepts, making it easier to follow along and stay engaged.\n\n2. **Active Note-Taking**:  \n   - Instead of writing down everything, try methods like the Cornell system or mind mapping. Focus on main ideas, questions, and summaries.

At the next event, set a mini-goal:  \n**Find one person, make eye contact, smile, and just ask one open-ended question** (e.g., “What brought you to this event?”). You don’t have to be the life of the party—just one genuine moment of connection. How does that sound?"
