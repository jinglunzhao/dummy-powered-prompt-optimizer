The good news is that this is a skill you can absolutely develop with practice—I've seen so many students grow in this area.\n\nLet's break this down into manageable steps. First, remember that most people in professional settings are actually quite understanding—they've been where you are! Here are some concrete things you can try:\n\n1. Start small with low-stakes practice:\n- Try striking up brief conversations with classmates before/after online lectures\n- Practice your \"elevator pitch\" about your studies in the mirror\n- Join a small student club related to computer science where the pressure is",

Starting with one-on-one interactions is actually a brilliant strategy—it's often way less overwhelming than group settings. And you know what? Most people in your program would probably be happy to grab coffee, especially if you frame it as wanting to connect with fellow computer science students.\n\nHere's a low-pressure way to approach it:\n1. Look for someone in your classes who seems approachable (maybe they post interesting questions in chat)\n2. Send a simple message like: \"Hey [name], I noticed your comment about [topic] in class—I found that really interesting.

Student's response to solutions: Initially nervous but engaged actively, showed physical signs of relaxation, began drafting resume and preparing calls. Evidence of progress/improvement: Shifted focus to manageable opportunities, recognized own skills, practiced de-escalation techniques, started concrete application steps.",

Since you're in journalism, being comfortable presenting is definitely a skill worth developing.  \n\nHere’s what I’d suggest:  \n1. **Start Small:** Practice presenting in low-pressure environments first—maybe record yourself talking about a topic you love (like a news story you’re passionate about) and watch it back.

Student's response to solutions: Casey showed relief and enthusiasm, particularly for the podcast idea and using emojis, and planned to implement these strategies. Evidence of progress/improvement: Casey's demeanor shifted from nervous to more relaxed and confident, with clear plans to apply the discussed techniques.",

Write down 5-7 questions beforehand (this takes the pressure off improvising)\n   - \"What does a typical day look like for you?\"\n   - \"What skills do you wish you'd developed more in school?\"\n   - \"How did you get your first position in this field?\"\n\n2. Remember: This isn't an interview - you're just learning. Most professionals enjoy sharing their journey.\n\n3. Have an exit strategy: \"I really appreciate your time - I'll let you get back to your day\" works perfectly after 20-30 minutes.",

Start practicing with smaller groups first—maybe present to friends or record yourself. Your extroverted nature will help here!\n2. Structure is key.

Let’s break this down into smaller, less overwhelming pieces.  \n\n**For networking/meeting new people:**  \n- **Start small:** Instead of jumping into big events, try low-pressure interactions first. For example, chat with *one* person in your class about an assignment, or ask a professor *one* question after lecture. Tiny wins build confidence.  \n- **Prep “scripts”",

The fact that you're reaching out for help is already a big step, and I’m really proud of you for that.  \n\nLet’s break this down into smaller, more manageable pieces. One thing that might help is practicing *micro-interactions*—tiny, low-pressure social moments that help you build confidence gradually. For example:  \n- **In class:** Start by making brief eye contact and smiling at someone sitting near you. You don’t even have to say anything at first!  \n- **At events:** If there’s a club or study",

Let's break this down into manageable pieces.\n\nFor public speaking, I'd recommend starting small to build confidence. Have you considered joining a low-pressure speaking group on campus? Many schools have Toastmasters clubs or debate societies where you can practice in a supportive environment. Another practical tip: try speaking up more in smaller classes first—maybe just asking one question per discussion—to get comfortable with your voice in academic settings.\n\nAbout those crowded spaces—since you mentioned low social anxiety but discomfort in large lectures, here's a trick I've seen work: arrive early to claim a seat where you feel",

Here's another pro tip: try scouting out 2-3 \"safe spot\" seats in different lecture halls during off-hours. That way you'll always have options.
