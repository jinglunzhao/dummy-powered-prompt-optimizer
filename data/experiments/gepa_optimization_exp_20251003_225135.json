Validation (\"guilt spiral—classic!\") and humor built rapport and reduced anxiety.\n\n**What could improve:** The mentor missed opportunities to explore *why* Alex over-schedules despite knowing it backfires. A brief question like \"What usually pushes you to pack your schedule?\" could uncover deeper patterns.\n\n**Key insight:** For overwhelmed, conscientious students, pair validation with *behavioral* micro-steps (like the 5-minute rule) instead of abstract advice.

Use Google Calendar or a planner to assign time for classes, studying, *and* downtime. Start small—over-scheduling backfires.  \n\n2. **Internship Prep**: For networking, ease into it. Attend 1-2 smaller department events this month (lower pressure). Prep 3 talking points (e.g., \"I loved Professor X’s lecture on Renaissance art—what’s your focus?\").  \n\n3. **Confidence Boost**: Practice elevator pitches in the mirror (\"I’m Alex, an Art History major passionate about museum curation\").

Let's break this down into manageable steps:\n\n1) **Research Phase** (This week):\n- Make a list of 5 local museums/galleries you admire\n- Check their websites' \"Careers\" or \"About\" sections for internship info\n- Note application deadlines (many summer ones open in Jan/Feb)\n\n2) **Prep Phase** (Next 2 weeks):\n- Draft a simple resume highlighting your art history coursework\n- Ask your favorite professor for feedback (they often have connections!)\n- Practice talking about why you love specific art movements\n\nWant to pick one museum to research together right now?

Avoid over-theorizing; focus on channeling their energy into structured opportunities."

Since you’re low on social anxiety but high in extraversion, lean into your natural sociability in smaller doses. Try these quick fixes:  \n1. **Public Speaking**: Join a CS club’s lightning-talk event (5-min presentations). Low stakes, high impact for grad apps.  \n2. **Networking**: Target 1-2 profs/industry folks monthly. Ask specific questions about their research—it’s less \"small talk,\" more substance.  \n3. **Lecture Halls**: Sit near the front + participate early. It’ll shrink the room mentally.  \n\nYou’ve got the openness to adapt—just channel it strategically. Which of these feels most doable right now?",

It’s way less noticeable than you think.  \n\nAnd scripting? Honestly, in tech, *preparation is power*. Think about it: debugging requires planning, right? You’re just applying that same structured thinking to communication—that’s a *skill*.  \n\n**Tiny tweak to try:** Next time you script a message, add *one* imperfect sentence at the end, like *\"Still figuring this out, but wanted to ask!\"* It keeps your prep but leaves room to feel human.  \n\nHow’s that sit with you? *(Noticing you’re grounding yourself with your hoodie—totally okay to take a breath here.)*",

Since you’re conscientious but struggle with balance, try these quick fixes:  \n\n1. **Time Management**: Block out 30 minutes tonight to map your week. Use Google Calendar or a planner to assign time for classes, studying, *and* downtime. Start small—over-scheduling backfires.  \n\n2. **Internship Prep**: For networking, ease into it. Attend 1-2 smaller department events this month (lower pressure). Prep 3 talking points (e.g., \"I loved Professor X’s lecture on Renaissance art—what’s your focus?\").  \n\n3. **Confidence Boost**: Practice elevator pitches in the mirror (\"I’m Alex, an Art History major passionate about museum curation\"). It feels silly but works.  \n\nWant to tackle one of these first? I’m happy to brainstorm specifics!",

Since you’re low on social anxiety but high in extraversion, lean into your natural sociability in smaller doses. Try these quick fixes:  \n1. **Public Speaking**: Join a CS club’s lightning-talk event (5-min presentations). Low stakes, high impact for grad apps.  \n2. **Networking**: Target 1-2 profs/industry folks monthly. Ask specific questions about their research—it’s less \"small talk,\" more substance.  \n3. **Lecture Halls**: Sit near the front + participate early.

First, let’s celebrate that you’re *aware* of this hurdle and want to grow. That’s huge!  \n\nA tiny step that might feel manageable: Could you try practicing with just *one* person this week? Maybe a classmate you already know (even via chat) or a professor during virtual office hours. You could prepare a simple question like, *\"What’s one thing you wish you’d known about our field when you started?\"*  \n\nWould that feel doable, or too much right now? I’m curious—what usually helps you feel slightly more at ease in conversations? (Even small things, like prepping a topic ahead of time?)  \n\n*(Meeting you where you are—no pressure to jump into big events yet!)*",

Validate the physical anxiety response (normalize it)  \n2. Reframe \"over-preparing\" as a strength in tech fields  \n3. Suggest a micro-adjustment to current scripting habit  \n\n**Response:**  \n\nJamie, first—shaky hands are just your body’s way of saying, *\"This matters to me!\"* Tons of people get them (even pros—I’ve seen CEOs spill coffee during pitches!). It’s way less noticeable than you think.  \n\nAnd scripting? Honestly, in tech, *preparation is power*. Think about it: debugging requires planning, right? You’re just applying that same structured thinking to communication—that’s a *skill*.  \n\n**Tiny tweak to try:** Next time you script a message, add *one* imperfect sentence at the end, like *\"Still figuring this out, but wanted to ask!\"* It keeps your prep but leaves room to feel human.  \n\nHow’s that sit with you? *(Noticing you’re grounding yourself with your hoodie—totally okay to take a breath here.)*",

Solutions offered included: 1) urgent/important grid to prioritize paper over club tasks, 2) time-blocking library sessions for focused work, 3) internship research targeting one museum with existing coursework as writing sample, and 4) 5-minute rule to overcome procrastination. Alex immediately implemented these by scheduling paper work first, club planning later, and a family call. Evidence of progress includes creating a prioritized timeline, adopting buffer zones to prevent over-scheduling, demonstrating proactive reminder systems, and displaying visible stress reduction through confident body language and concrete planning.",
