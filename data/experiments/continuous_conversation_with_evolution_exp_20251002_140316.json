Try this structure: \n\n1. Start with a warm intro (\"Hi, I'm Gregory, a CS junior focusing on AI applications\")\n2. Mention 1-2 specific research interests \n3. End with an open question (\"I'd love to hear about your work with neural networks\")\n\nPractice it out loud 3-5 times daily - record yourself to catch any nervous habits. For the loans, let's chat after the mixer about budgeting tools and RA positions that offer tuition benefits. You've got this!",

First off, I want to say it's totally normal to feel this way—many students struggle with networking, especially when starting out.  \n\nSince you're more comfortable online, here are a few low-pressure steps:  \n1. **Start with LinkedIn** – Connect with alumni from your program (they often want to help!). A simple message like: *\"Hi [Name], I saw we both studied CS at Online University. I’d love to hear about your career path—would you have 15 minutes for a virtual coffee chat?\"*  \n2. **Join Slack/Discord groups** – Many tech communities (like r/cscareerquestions) have online spaces where you can ask questions without face-to-face",

Jamie showed progress by negotiating hydration compromises and physically approaching the CS club. Crucially, Jamie transformed avoidance into creative action by linking a QR code to their resume and conceptualizing a coding project ('donut visualizer'), indicating improved initiative.

For the internship hunt, set small weekly goals like \"research 3 museums this week\" or \"complete 1 application by Friday.\" With the club, recruit a friend to help share responsibilities.

Try the \"25-minute rule\": Do one Pomodoro (25 min) of Python after finishing your journalism work as a reward. It's manageable and guilt-free.\n\n2. Sync your learning: Practice Python by analyzing datasets for journalism stories. Two birds, one stone!\n\n3. Schedule coding like a class: Block out just 2-3 hours weekly (maybe Saturday mornings?) so it doesn't bleed into study time.\n\nRemember, even 30 minutes weekly adds up over a semester.

Marketing clubs often have presentation workshops too.\n\n2) Career prep: Start doing informational interviews with alumni from your program (LinkedIn makes this easy). Ask about their career paths and what skills are in demand. \n\n3) Loans: Meet with your financial aid office to explore income-driven repayment options post-graduation. \n\nWant to grab coffee and brainstorm some specific companies you're interested in?

Here's a practical tip: start small with study groups of 2-3 classmates - it's less intimidating than large lectures. For presentations, practice in front of your mirror first, then record yourself to build confidence. \n\nWant to explore cultures? Check out language exchange clubs on campus - great way to learn while making friends. And remember, it's okay to feel anxious; even the most confident people struggle sometimes. You've got this!",

Use your extraversion by forming study groups - teaching concepts to peers reinforces learning while being social.\n\n2. **Extracurricular Balance**: Create a color-coded calendar blocking class time, study sessions, and club meetings. Pro tip: Limit yourself to 2-3 high-impact activities that align with your bio major/pre-med goals.\n\n3. **Public Speaking**: Start small by asking one question per lecture.
