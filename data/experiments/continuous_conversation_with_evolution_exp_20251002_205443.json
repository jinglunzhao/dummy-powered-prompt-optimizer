For networking, solutions included prepared talking points, transition questions, and genuine compliments - all practiced successfully with the coach.

Progress was evident through Casey's implementation of discreet breathing techniques, detailed environmental planning (noting outlets and timing), self-generated reporter mindset, and accountability systems (reminders, progress reports). Casey responded positively by creating personalized adaptations of strategies, initiating new techniques like photo visualization, and committing to exposure therapy through planned room walk-bys.",

She showed rapid progress - transforming her opener, adopting conversational pacing, and gaining enjoyment in the process. For career fairs, they roleplayed networking strategies, leading Lisa to develop authentic approaches like humor-based icebreakers ('cheese platter danger') and an elevator pitch blending her viral TikTok success (83K views) with professional goals.

Your extraversion means you'll thrive by scheduling this with an accountability partner.\n\n2. **Financial Stress Relief**: Let's set up a simple loan tracking spreadsheet (I can share a template).

It makes the space feel smaller and helps you engage more with the professor. \n\nSince you mentioned networking, here's a quick tip: try connecting with just one new person after each pre-med club meeting. Maybe ask about their research interests or shadowing experiences. Small, consistent steps add up!\n\nWhat's one specific networking goal you'd like to achieve this semester?

Solutions offered: For lecture anxiety - continue front-row seating (proven effective in organic chemistry); For networking - read 1-2 of Dr. Chen's papers and send concise email with specific research reference; For overthinking - immediate email sending after drafting. Zachary responded positively: Implemented email strategy immediately, sent professional inquiry to Dr. Chen using provided template, and reported reduced mental burden. Evidence of progress: Successfully overcame weeks-long hesitation by sending the email, applied lecture strategy with self-reported effectiveness in organic chemistry, and demonstrated behavioral change by taking quick action instead of overcomplicating tasks.",

Solutions: 1) Reinforced front-row seating strategy (which Zachary already implements successfully in orgo), 2) Co-created actionable email approach (read 1-2 papers + reference specific finding). Zachary immediately sent the email, reporting reduced stress and mental freed capacity for exam prep. Progress evidenced by: completed mentor outreach after weeks of delay, implementation of anxiety-reducing seating tactics, scheduled self-care, and recognition that simplified action beats prolonged overthinking. Physical indicators included confident posture and proactive planning.",
