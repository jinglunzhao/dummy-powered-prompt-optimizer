Time management: Try the \"time blocking\" method - schedule specific hours for studying, clubs, and self-care. Even 15-minute blocks help.\n\n3.

Specific, actionable steps (emailing 1 professor, financial aid visit) provided clear direction.\n\n**What could improve:** Allowed excessive off-topic tangents about dating/flirting, diluting focus on core goals (networking, grad apps). Should gently but firmly redirect sooner.\n\n**Key insight:** For highly specialized students, harness their domain passion to build social confidence, but establish clear boundaries to prevent metaphorical over-extension into unrelated areas. Validate identity while anchoring to practical objectives."

Somatic techniques weren’t reinforced when Alex later gulped nervously.  \n\n**Key insight:**  \nFor low-extraversion/high-anxiety students, pairing micro-actions with *personalized sensory rewards* (e.g., coffee + art) builds momentum faster than generic advice. Their guilt often stems from undervaluing restoration—explicitly reframing breaks as \"fuel\" is crucial."

For the internship worry, try this micro-step: spend just 10 minutes today updating one section of your LinkedIn or resume. Small, consistent actions build momentum. \n\nI hear \"balance\" coming up a lot—what does that word mean to you specifically? Sometimes clarifying our definitions helps reveal what we truly need. \n\n*Quick grounding technique*: Place both feet flat on the floor, take three slow breaths, and notice which part of your body feels most tense. Just acknowledging that can help. \n\nWhat's one thing that could make today feel 5% more manageable?",

Celebrating small wins (\"micro-win\") reinforced progress.\n\n**What to improve:**  \nProbing deeper into Gregory’s core fear of \"sounding stupid\" earlier could address his root insecurity. The mentor missed chances to explore why he equates mistakes with failure.  \n\n**Key insight:**  \nFor high-anxiety/high-extraversion students, combine *immediate tools* (scripts, somatic hacks) with *gentle reframing* of self-judgment (\"Am I being curious?\" > \"Do I sound stupid?\").

Tangible rewards and humor built motivation.\n\n**What to improve:** Avoid escalating complexity when the student adds new challenges (e.g., sitting at the front); gently reinforce the core micro-step first to prevent overwhelm.\n\n**Key insight:** For high-anxiety students, strictly maintaining micro-step boundaries is crucial—celebrate initiative but contain scope creep to solidify confidence through repetition before expanding."

Respect his expressed boundaries more directly.\n\n**Key insight:** For highly extraverted but anxious students, leverage their social energy by co-creating *minimal* interaction scripts and honoring their self-awareness about what coping tools feel authentic (\"breathing helps\" vs. visualization).

Briefly revisiting one during stress points would strengthen regulation.\n\n**Key insight:** For high-anxiety/low-extraversion students, *microscopic* initial steps (e.g., 15 seconds) build momentum; consistently pairing these with somatic tools during anxious moments deepens self-regulation skills."

Breaking networking into micro-steps (one comment, email drafting) made it manageable. Celebrating small wins (sending the email) built momentum.\n\n**What to improve:** Could probe deeper into *why* Gregory fears being seen as \"dumb\" or \"kissing up\" earlier. Jumping to solutions sometimes bypassed exploring the root of his catastrophizing thoughts more thoroughly.\n\n**Key insight:** For high-extraversion/high-anxiety students, leverage their natural sociability while directly addressing their specific fear of judgment (\"looking stupid\"). Balance practical scripts with deeper exploration of cognitive distortions to build authentic confidence."

          "**What worked:**  \nThe mentor effectively validated Gregory's anxiety while using humor and momentum (\"let's do this now\") to build engagement, matching his high extraversion. Micro-steps (scripted messages, paper skimming) reduced overwhelm.\n\n**What to improve:**  \nSomatic techniques (foot grounding, breathing) weren’t consistently reinforced when anxiety spiked mid-task. Missed probing *why* \"feeling stupid\" triggers him (e.g., perfectionism? comparison?).\n\n**Key insight:**  \nFor high-extraversion/high-anxiety students:  \n- Sustain momentum with micro-actions and humor to leverage their energy.  \n- Embed somatic tools *during* tasks (\"Pause: press your feet for 5 sec before typing\").  \n- Probe core fears behind surface worries."

The praise (\"nailed it!\", \"natural\") boosted his confidence visibly.\n\n**What could improve:** The AI missed Gregory's subtle anxiety cues (shifting, nervous chuckle about freezing) when discussing the financial aid office. A brief acknowledgment (\"It's normal to feel hesitant walking in\") before practice would have deepened trust.\n\n**Key insight:** For energetic, low-anxiety students, pair tactical preparation with *explicit* validation of minor nerves to prevent overlooked stressors from undermining their momentum."

For public speaking in large lectures, try this: sit near the front and make eye contact with 1-2 engaged students—it creates a more intimate feel. For networking, arrive 10 minutes early to small events when fewer people are there—easier to start conversations. \n\nWhat specific grad programs are you considering? Knowing this could help us strategize both mentor-finding and loan management approaches. \n\nAlso, have you tried practicing talks with your CS study group first? Low-pressure peer settings build confidence. \n\nYou've got this—your awareness is already half the battle! What's one networking or speaking situation coming up where you could try these tips?",

          "Here's the concise reflection:\n\n**What worked:** The mentor effectively used humor and tangible metaphors (journalism framing, cat) to build rapport and reduce Casey's anxiety, making challenges feel approachable. Micro-steps (15-minute mixer, cat practice) were well-sized and paired with somatic techniques (toe wiggling, grounding).\n\n**What could improve:** The mentor missed opportunities to gently probe the *core motivation* behind Casey's goal (e.g., \"What does 'balance' look like for *you*?\" or \"What impact do you hope confidence will have?\"). Exit strategies (e.g., cloud joke) risked reinforcing avoidance rather than addressing root anxiety.\n\n**Key insight:** For high-anxiety students, anchor advice in their identity/interests (Casey's journalism) to transform abstract fears into concrete, identity-congruent actions (\"gathering quotes,\" \"interview adrenaline\"). Always link tactics back to their deeper \"why.\""

For networking, try this: Before events, research 2-3 attendees (LinkedIn helps) and prepare one open-ended question for each, like *\"What projects are you excited about?\"* This gives you a script to fall back on. Would you like to practice a mock conversation together?  \n\nFor interviews: Record yourself answering *\"Tell me about yourself\"* (just 60 seconds!). Review it to spot strengths—not just nerves.
