Offering specific, bite-sized strategies (breathing trick, low-stakes practice, email formula) gave him immediate, actionable steps, reducing overwhelm.\n\n**What could improve:** While practical, the advice could delve deeper into *why* large settings trigger anxiety despite his extraversion. A brief exploration of this paradox might yield more tailored coping strategies beyond surface techniques.\n\n**Key insight:** For high-extraversion students, leverage their social energy with playful, practical micro-steps (\"30-second practice,\" roleplay) while explicitly normalizing that situational anxiety doesn't contradict their outgoing nature. Focus on translating their natural enthusiasm into structured preparation."

Here's what works for me:  \n\n1) **Practice in low-stakes settings first** (e.g., club meetings, study group explanations)  \n2) **Use the \"3-second breath trick\"** before speaking—inhale for 3, hold for 3, exhale for 3 (calms nerves fast)  \n3) **Volunteer to go first** in class presentations—gets it over with and professors often grade easier early on  \n\nWant to try a 30-second practice run now?
