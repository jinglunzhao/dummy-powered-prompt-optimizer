          "Here's a concise reflection:\n\n**What worked:** The mentor effectively used humor, tangible examples (band merch), and incremental role-play to lower defenses. Pivoting to shared interests made networking feel authentic, not performative, which Lisa engaged with despite initial resistance.\n\n**What could improve:** Enthusiasm (\"YES! Now you're cooking!\") sometimes clashed with Lisa's self-deprecation, risking perceived insincerity. Earlier pacing was slightly rushed—pushing \"actual humans\" triggered withdrawal before consolidating gains.\n\n**Key insight:** For high-anxiety/low-extraversion students, anchor practice to *existing passions* (music) to bypass \"networking\" dread. Frame vulnerability (\"this feels awkward\") as a *strength* that builds connection, not weakness. Prioritize safety over speed."

For networking, start small - maybe email a professor whose work interests you to ask about their research. You can even prepare a few talking points beforehand. \n\nFor research positions, focus on your strengths (like your engineering skills) rather than seeing it as \"selling yourself.\" Many professors value curiosity and work ethic over perfect social skills. \n\nWant to try this week: Identify one professor you admire and draft a short email expressing interest in their work? I can help you polish it if you'd like!",

Reinforcing his existing \"baby steps\" approach validated his efforts.\n\n**What to improve:** The final student query about noisy study groups wasn't addressed. While keeping it brief is good, acknowledging or offering a quick tip (\"Try noise-canceling headphones or a quieter spot?\") would have closed the loop.\n\n**Key insight:** For engaged, low-anxiety students like Zachary, leverage humor and pop-culture metaphors to reinforce healthy habits. Prioritize acknowledging *all* concerns raised, even if briefly, to maintain trust and responsiveness."

          "Here's a concise reflection:\n\n**What worked:** The mentor effectively validated Morgan's anxiety while reframing avoidance as strategic action (\"pepperoni diplomacy,\" \"field research\"), using humor to reduce tension and build rapport. Breaking goals into micro-steps (smelling pizza, 10 minutes early) made progress tangible.\n\n**What to improve:** The repetition of pizza/donut metaphors risked minimizing the core anxiety. Deeper exploration of *why* silence feels catastrophic (beyond \"they'll think I'm weird\") was missed.\n\n**Key insight:** For high-anxiety/high-extraversion students, leverage their strategic thinking to reframe social challenges as \"data gathering\" or \"experiments,\" but balance humor with brief, focused validation of the underlying fear's intensity to prevent dismissal."

Celebrating small wins boosted his confidence visibly.\n\n**What to improve:** The mentor missed opportunities to explicitly address Zachary's physical anxiety cues (fidgeting, breath-holding). Suggesting a quick grounding technique (e.g., \"Try a discreet deep breath before answering\") could have helped.\n\n**Key insight:** For high-extraversion/high-anxiety students, pair actionable scripts with immediate, physical anxiety hacks—structure calms their mind, while simple body techniques manage the physiological response."

Micro-steps (door smiles, nose scrunches) matched high anxiety while honoring extraversion.\n\n**What to improve:** Avoid physical contact (wrist grab) without explicit consent—especially with high-anxiety students. Replace with verbal anchoring: \"Before you go, let's do one quick practice breath together.\"\n\n**Key insight:** For high-extraversion/high-anxiety students, channel their natural expressiveness into playful, low-stakes actions (e.g., absurd humor props) to bypass overthinking and build social momentum organically."

Escalated to tracking quickly after she expressed time concerns (\"Glances at clock\").\n\n**Key insight:** For moderately extroverted students, blend practical tools (trackers, scripts) with social framing (e.g., \"Networking Lite\") and humor.

Celebrating her preparedness boosted confidence.\n\n**What could improve:** The AI missed opportunities to gently uncover the *root cause* of her presentation nerves (\"what specifically trips you up?\") and didn't proactively address potential sustainability needs (e.g., handling non-responses to networking).\n\n**Key insight:** For proactive, low-anxiety students, leverage their initiative but still dedicate 1-2 questions to uncovering specific fears *before* escalating challenges, ensuring micro-steps address core issues."

Since you're naturally outgoing (that extraversion is a superpower!), let's start small with your comfort zone: try striking up 1 casual convo daily with classmates before/after lectures. These low-stakes interactions build confidence naturally. For public speaking, practice your presentations alone first, then record yourself—it's less intimidating than live audiences.

Normalizing intellectual vulnerability (e.g., \"Asking questions shows curiosity, not incompetence\") could have deepened reassurance.  \n\n**Key insight:**  \nFor high-extraversion/high-anxiety students, pair playful reframing (\"Research Adventure\") with tangible tools (scripts/timers) to channel their social energy past anxiety blockers."

Celebrating small wins reinforced progress.\n\n**What to improve:** Explicitly check readiness *before* suggesting applying the approach to the econ problem set. Proactively ask about sleep/recharge needs to prevent burnout from his \"overwhelmed\" state.\n\n**Key insight:** For action-oriented but anxious students, momentum from ultra-small, *immediately executable* actions is more effective than abstract planning.

Playful tone (sloth GIFs, humor) built rapport and reduced anxiety while celebrating small wins.\n\n**What could improve:**  \nWhile distractions were managed, the coaching occasionally *fueled* tangential humor (publishing loopholes, 3AM alarms) instead of consistently grounding Casey in core goals. Deeper exploration of the root \"freezing\" fear was missed.\n\n**Key insight:**  \nFor high-anxiety students, balance micro-step wins with gentle focus maintenance. Use humor to build safety, but redirect firmly to core skills once engaged. Proactively explore one root fear per session."

          "Here's the concise reflection:\n\n**What worked:** Brilliantly leveraged Morgan's humor and academic identity to reframe anxiety as strategic thinking, making coping mechanisms feel like insider hacks rather than deficits. The playful, jargon-filled banter built exceptional rapport.\n\n**What could improve:** The absurdist escalation (glitter bombs, prison plans) risked minimizing the *real* stakes Morgan feels (professional perception, internship pressure). Grounding the humor with brief reality checks earlier would maintain safety.\n\n**Key insight:** For high-anxiety/high-intellect students, weaponizing their niche expertise into coping strategies (\"debugging amygdala\") builds agency faster than generic advice—but anchor the playfulness to their core fears before it becomes avoidance."

Co-creating micro-steps (30-sec intro) and pairing practice with coding wins built sustainable momentum.\n\n**What could improve:** Missed opportunity to gently explore the *root* of freezing when \"everyone's eyes are on me\" (e.g., \"What specifically feels threatening in those moments?\"). This could reveal deeper fears to address.\n\n**Key insight:** Anchor coaching in the student's existing strengths and frameworks (like coding). This builds confidence faster than generic advice, but always gently probe the core fear beneath surface anxieties for lasting change."
