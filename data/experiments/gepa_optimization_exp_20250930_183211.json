Since you're low in social anxiety but high in extraversion, what specific situations make conversations feel like \"a whole thing\" for you?\n\nFor a concrete step, try joining one campus club related to your interests this week. This creates natural, low-pressure opportunities to practice talking with peers who share your passions. You've got this!",
