Many of my CS friends got their first internships through professor recommendations from RA work.\n\nAnd yes! Mirror practice is low-stakes but super effective. Try recording yourself too - it's awkward at first, but you'll spot little improvements fast. Want to meet at the CS lounge tomorrow to run through your pitch? We can grab those budget sheets too.",

When you're ready, try reaching out to just 1 alumni from your program with a simple message like: \"Hi [Name], I saw we both studied CS at Online University. Would you have 15 minutes to share your career journey?\" Most people love helping students!\n\nAbout job applications - rejection is normal (I got 20+ rejections before my first yes!). Maybe set a small goal, like applying to 1 \"practice\" job this week where you're okay with not getting it. You've got this! *virtual fist bump*",
