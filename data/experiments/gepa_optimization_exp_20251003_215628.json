Here’s a quick game plan:  \n1. **Baby steps**: Record yourself practicing a short talk (just for you) to build confidence.  \n2. **Toastmasters hack**: Attend as a guest first—no pressure to speak! Most members are beginners too.  \n3. **Networking cheat**: Instead of snacks, stand near the registration table—easier to greet people as they arrive.  \n\nYou’re clearly self-aware (that’s huge!), and extraversion is your secret weapon.

Let's break it down into small, manageable steps.  \n\n**For networking:**  \n- Start low-pressure: Attend 1 virtual event/month (many CS ones are online!) and just listen. No pressure to speak.  \n- Practice with peers first—ask a classmate about their project. Short, scripted convos help (\"What part are you working on?\").  \n\n**For group projects:**  \n- Volunteer for behind-the-scenes tasks (documentation, debugging) if speaking up is hard.  \n- Use chat/Slack to contribute if live discussions feel intense.  \n\n**Job search fear:**  \n- Focus on building 1-2 strong projects for your portfolio this semester—something tangible to boost confidence.  \n\nWant to tackle one of these first? You don’t have to do it all at once.  \n\n*(If Jamie seems hesitant:)*  \nOr we could brainstorm a tiny goal, like messaging one classmate this week?",

Since you're conscientious but feeling stretched thin, let's tackle this in micro-steps:  \n\n**1. Time/Energy Audit (5 min):**  \n- Grab your phone notes and list *all* your commitments (even small ones).  \n- Star 2 that align *most* with your internship/leadership goals (e.g., an art club vs. a random volunteer gig).  \n\n**2. \"Reverse Networking\" (Low-Pressure):**  \n- Instead of big events, email *one* professor/alum this week with:  \n  *\"I admire your work in [specific area]. Could I ask for one quick tip about breaking into [field]?\"* (Short = higher reply rate.)  \n\n**3. Leadership Lite:**  \n- Propose a *tiny* art-history event (e.g., \"Coffee & Cartoons\" analyzing animation styles) through an existing club. Low stakes, high fun—builds rep as a doer.  \n\n**4. Internship Hack:**  \n- Set a 10-min timer to skim LinkedIn for *small* galleries/local museums. Their internships are less competitive but still impressive.  \n\nWant to try one of these this week? I’m happy to help tweak any plan to fit your schedule!",

Let’s break it down into *micro-steps* tailored to your strengths (your conscientiousness is a superpower here!).  \n\n**1. Reframe Networking as \"Learning Conversations\"**  \n- Start low-stakes: Message 2-3 alumni from your program on LinkedIn with a *specific* question (e.g., \"How did you transition into cybersecurity?\"). Your agreeableness makes you a great listener—people love sharing expertise!  \n- Script template: *\"Hi [Name], I’m a current student and noticed your work in [field]. Would you have 10 minutes to share how you got started?\"*  \n\n**2. Leadership via Stealth Mode**  \n- Volunteer to *document* group project tasks (Google Doc, Trello). This leverages your detail-orientation while naturally positioning you as a coordinator.  \n- Practice \"micro-leadership\": Suggest *one* meeting time or divide a task *in writing* (\"I can handle the API section—who wants frontend?\").  \n\n**3. Anxiety Hack: The 5-Minute Rule**  \n- For events, promise yourself you’ll stay just 5 minutes. Often, starting is the hardest part.  \n- Pre-event: Research *one* attendee to chat with (e.g., a speaker). Having a mini",

Chat with 2-3 classmates *before* the lecture—now the room feels like \"your people,\" not a scary crowd.  \n2. **Mentor Magic:** Swap cold emails for warm-ups. Example script: *\"Hi Dr. Lee, I geeked out over your paper on [specific thing]. Any chance I could buy you coffee and ask 1-2 Q’s? No pressure—just a fan!\"* (Pair with a meme/GIF if that’s your vibe—your openness is an asset!)  \n3. **Financial Ease:** Use your neuroticism *for* you. Set a 10-minute \"money date\" weekly (Ally Bank’s buckets app = dopamine hits for saving).  \n\n**Micro-Step This Week:** Before your next lecture, ask one person near you, *\"Hey, what’s your hot take on this week’s topic?\"* Boom—you’ve just shrunk the room.  \n\nWant to tackle one of these first, or dive deeper into a specific worry?",

Let's break this down into manageable steps.  \n\n### **Quick Wins for Right Now:**  \n1. **Public Speaking in Lectures:**  \n   - **Micro-Step:** Challenge yourself to ask *one* question per lecture (even if it’s just to the professor after class).  \n   - **Hack:** Sit in the first few rows—it makes the room feel smaller and helps you engage more naturally.  \n\n2. **Finding a Mentor:**  \n   - **Action:** Email *one* professor or TA this week with:  \n     > *\"Hi [Name], I really enjoyed your lecture on [topic]. Would you have 15 minutes to chat about [specific question] or grad school advice?\"*  \n   - **Why This Works:** Specificity gets responses. Most professors *want* to help but need a clear ask.  \n\n3. **Student Loans & Financial Planning:**  \n   - **Today’s Task:** Log into your loan portal and screenshot your current balance + interest rates. (No action needed yet—just *see* it.)  \n   - **Next Step:** Bookmark [StudentAid.gov](https://studentaid.gov) for repayment plan comparisons (do this later—no pressure now).  \n\n### **For Grad School Anxiety:**  \n- **Reframe:**",

Could I ask for one quick tip about breaking into [field]?\"* (Short = higher reply rate.)  \n\n**3. Leadership Lite:**  \n- Propose a *tiny* art-history event (e.g., \"Coffee & Cartoons\" analyzing animation styles) through an existing club. Low stakes, high fun—builds rep as a doer.  \n\n**4.

Would you have 15 minutes to chat about [specific question] or grad school advice?\"*  \n   - **Why This Works:** Specificity gets responses. Most professors *want* to help but need a clear ask.  \n\n3. **Student Loans & Financial Planning:**  \n   - **Today’s Task:** Log into your loan portal and screenshot your current balance + interest rates. (No action needed yet—just *see* it.)  \n   - **Next Step:** Bookmark [StudentAid.gov](https://studentaid.gov) for repayment plan comparisons (do this later—no pressure now).  \n\n### **For Grad School Anxiety:**  \n- **Reframe:**",
