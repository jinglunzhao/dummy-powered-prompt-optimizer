Solutions offered/accepted: 1) Reframing campus experiences as relevant qualifications, 2) Creating video application materials showcasing skills, 3) Time-blocking with 30-minute focused sessions. Student's response: Positively identified transferable skills (exhibition curation, research transcription), scheduled concrete actions (video filming, bullet point preparation), and demonstrated initiative (walking brainstorming session). Evidence of progress: Shifted from self-doubt to recognizing own qualifications, created actionable plan for application enhancement, and showed increased confidence through proactive behaviors.",

Let's tackle one thing at a time - which area feels most pressing right now? \n\nFor the social anxiety, would you like to try a simple grounding technique before social situations? Breathe in for 4, hold for 4, out for 4. It's okay to take small steps. \n\nYour desire to learn coding and languages shows such wonderful curiosity! What draws you to these skills specifically? Sometimes connecting to our \"why\" helps motivation. \n\nRemember, progress isn't linear. What's one small win you've had recently? I'd love to celebrate that with you.",

Let's break this down together. What specifically feels most daunting about presentations? Is it the preparation, the delivery, or something else? \n\nFor the workload, have you tried time-blocking your assignments? Even 15 minutes of focused work can build momentum. And about your career path - what excites you most in your Communications studies? Sometimes starting with what energizes us can clarify next steps. \n\nWould you like to try some breathing exercises together to help with the presentation anxiety?",
