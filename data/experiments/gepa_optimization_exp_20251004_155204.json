And remember, it's okay to say no to some extracurriculars if you're feeling overwhelmed—quality over quantity!\n\nAbout internships: start small.

First off, it’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed, especially when you’re aiming high with internships and leadership. The fact that you’re even thinking about these things shows how proactive you are!  \n\nSince you mentioned networking feels tricky, let’s break it down: What’s worked for you in the past when meeting new people in lower-pressure settings? (Like chatting with classmates or smaller group events?) Sometimes reflecting on those smaller wins can help build confidence for bigger networking moments.  \n\nFor internships, have you tried mapping out smaller steps?

And remember, it's okay to say no to some extracurriculars if you're feeling overwhelmed—quality over quantity!\n\nAbout internships: start small.

These low-pressure conversations can lead to great opportunities.\n\nFor social confidence at events: try arriving early when there are fewer",
