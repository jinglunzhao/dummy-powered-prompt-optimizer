They have a super supportive environment for practicing speeches. Also, a pro tip—start small by volunteering to answer questions in your smaller seminar classes first. The more you do it, the more natural it'll feel.\n\nAbout networking: Since large events feel daunting, why not try more targeted 1:1 connections?

Maybe begin with online interactions first since you're at Online University - comment on LinkedIn posts from people in your field, or join a Slack/Discord community for CS students. This lets you practice professional communication without the face-to-face pressure. When you're ready, you could try virtual coffee chats with alumni from your program - they were in your shoes once and usually want to help.\n\nFor group projects (which I know can be brutal with anxiety), here's a trick: come prepared",

You're already self-aware about what you want to improve, which is a huge first step.

Map out your week in advance, assigning specific blocks for classes, studying, and downtime. Apps like Google Calendar or Notion can help. For example, maybe you reserve mornings for intense study sessions (when your brain is fresh) and afternoons for lighter tasks or club meetings.  \n- Prioritize ruthlessly. Not everything has",

Instead of seeing it as this big, scary performance where you have to impress everyone, think of it as just *meeting people* who share your interests. You’re an engineering student, right?

Let’s break this down into smaller, more manageable pieces so it feels less overwhelming.  \n\n**For Networking/Office Hours:**  \n- **Start small:** Instead of diving into big events, try practicing with low-stakes interactions. For example, ask a classmate about an assignment or compliment someone’s laptop sticker. These tiny wins build confidence.  \n- **Prep talking points:** Before office hours, jot down 1-2 questions about the",

It's awesome that you're tackling public speaking and networking—those are such valuable skills, especially in biology where collaboration and presenting research are key.

Start small: Raise your hand *once* per lecture with a question or comment. Even something simple like \"Could you clarify that last point?\" counts as practice.\n2. Use the \"3-second rule\": When you feel nervous, pause and take 3 deep breaths before speaking. This helps steady your voice.\n3. Practice with friends first: Try explaining a biology concept to your roommate or study group. The informal setting builds confidence.\n\n**For Networking",
