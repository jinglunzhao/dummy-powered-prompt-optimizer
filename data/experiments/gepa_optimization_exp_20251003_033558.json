Hyper-specific micro-steps (chatting pre-presentation, asking about projects) matched his low anxiety and provided clear wins.\n\n**What to improve:** Missed a brief opportunity to gently explore his underlying resistance (\"overwhelmed\" feeling, improv aversion) beyond surface-level jokes, potentially leaving core triggers unaddressed.\n\n**Key insight:** For high-extraversion/low-anxiety students, channel their natural energy and domain-specific passions (e.g., tech) into structured practice.

Let’s break it down:  \n\n1. **Time Blocking**: Try color-coding your calendar (class=blue, social=green, etc.)—it’ll help visualize balance.  \n2. **Social Energy**: Pick 1-2 events/week that align with your org goals (e.g., networking with art clubs). Quality > quantity!  \n3. **Micro-Step**: Draft a 3-sentence \"pitch\" for your org idea this week. Just for fun—no pressure to share yet.  \n\nYou’ve got this!

          "Here's a concise reflection:\n\n**What worked:** The mentor effectively adapted to Jamie's high anxiety by pivoting to text-based practice, validating her needs, and breaking tasks into achievable micro-steps (e.g., \"one person\" goal). Celebrating small wins (\"Today’s win\") built momentum.\n\n**What could improve:** Pushing for a voice memo after Jamie declined recording risked pressure; respecting her \"no\" fully was crucial. Earlier career fair prep (e.g., scanning lists) could have been introduced sooner given her time-sensitive panic.\n\n**Key insight:** For highly anxious students, *co-creating* practice methods (text/mirror vs. recording) and letting them set the pace reduces resistance faster than standardized approaches. Flexibility is confidence-building."

Celebrating small wins (\"win file\") built momentum.\n\n**What to improve:** Slightly rushed pacing after Jamie's \"scripted\" fear; could have briefly validated that concern before reframing to deepen trust. The \"high-five\" suggestion, while well-intentioned, might feel overwhelming for someone at this anxiety level.\n\n**Key insight:** For high-anxiety/low-extraversion students, *safety scaffolding* (private practice, zero-judgment zones) is more critical than skill perfection early on.

Over-indexed on enthusiasm without anchoring strategies for when energy dips.\n\n**Key insight:** For highly extraverted students, channel their natural expressiveness into structured creative tasks (\"adversarial glitter\" pivot) but pair with concrete anxiety buffers for vulnerable moments."
