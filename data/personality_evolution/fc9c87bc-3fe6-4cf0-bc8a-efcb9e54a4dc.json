Solutions offered included: 1) Structured application drafting with professor feedback, 2) Lecture recording for desensitization, 3) Financial aid meeting, and 4) Scheduled family calls. Lisa implemented key solutions immediately: emailed Dr. Carter with specific questions, blocked work time, called her mother, recorded a practice lecture, and submitted her application. Progress is evident through her adoption of concrete strategies (color-coding interview prep, using cloud storage), decreased defensiveness (accepting templates while pretending annoyance), and proactive outreach to professors. Her anxiety visibly decreased from initial panic to focused action.",
