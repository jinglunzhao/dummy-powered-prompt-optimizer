Solutions offered included using physical cues to maintain lecture focus, breaking assignments into manageable 'good enough' chunks, in-person networking with professors, and investigating income-driven loan repayment. Lisa responded positively to these concrete suggestions, agreeing to try the focus techniques, adopt a more practical approach to assignments, target a specific professor for networking, and research financial options. Evidence of progress includes her willingness to implement these strategies, a slight reduction in overwhelmed demeanor, and specific action plans for immediate next steps.",
