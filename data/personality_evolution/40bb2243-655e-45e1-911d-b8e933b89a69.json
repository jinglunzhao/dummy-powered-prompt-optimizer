Solutions offered/accepted: Sit closer to the front in lectures, initiate small talk with a friendly classmate, use deep breathing techniques, and start with low-pressure questions. Student's response to solutions: Agreed to try sitting closer and initiating one small conversation, recognized overthinking, and expressed gratitude. Evidence of progress/improvement: Student felt slightly more prepared to take social risks and planned concrete steps for the next lecture.",

Solutions offered/accepted: 1) Starting with basic comments to classmates (\"problem three?\") and introducing herself, 2) Using a scripted pause phrase during presentations, 3) Alternative small talk about granola bars if seating is too crowded. Student's response: Sarah showed visible relief (giggling, relaxed shoulders), agreed to try the strategies, and wrote them down as a commitment. Evidence of progress: Sarah moved from extreme nervousness to expressing hope and making a concrete plan, demonstrating reduced anxiety through body language and verbal agreement to implement solutions.",
