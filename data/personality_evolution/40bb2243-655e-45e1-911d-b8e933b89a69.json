The AI Coach offered concrete solutions: preparing/writing specific questions, using 'I'm curious...' framing, practicing aloud, and starting with one question per session. Sarah positively responded by: 1) Creating a question notebook 2) Practicing her Taylor series question aloud 3) Role-playing follow-up questions 4) Committing to try 'I'm curious' framing. Progress is evident through her decreased avoidance behaviors (willingness to practice verbally), adoption of tools (notebook), use of humor about anxiety ('tamale rebellion'), and concrete planning for classroom rehearsals. She demonstrated increased self-efficacy by planning to implement strategies independently.",
