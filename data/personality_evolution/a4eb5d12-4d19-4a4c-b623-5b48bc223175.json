The coach offered concrete solutions: simplifying planning (2-color system), breaking tasks into micro-steps (90-minute blocks), and accountability check-ins. Alex immediately implemented these by selecting a top internship, adopting the simplified planner, and scheduling Friday reviews. Progress is evident through reduced perfectionism (limiting portfolio pieces), self-awareness about overcommitment, and proactive problem-solving (backup Etsy plan). The student responded positively to structure, humorously engaging with solutions while demonstrating tangible next steps.",

The coach offered concrete solutions: simplifying the planner to two colors, breaking tasks into micro-steps (e.g., 'research 3 museums this week'), and scheduling accountability check-ins. Alex actively accepted these strategies—switching to the simplified planner, committing to start one application, and preparing a focused portfolio. Progress is evident in Alex's shift from paralysis ('staring at listings for weeks') to action-oriented statements ('Operation Color-Coded Life starts now'), use of humor to diffuse perfectionism, and establishment of a structured Friday check-in ritual.
