Solutions offered included the 3-Question Rule, Active Listening Focus, and 5-Second Reset techniques, as well as structured question preparation (specialized and bridge questions) and the ARE method for follow-ups. Alex responded positively, practicing role-playing scenarios and showing relief in having a concrete plan. Evidence of progress includes successfully refining questions, using the ARE method, and demonstrating increased confidence in handling specific and unfamiliar topics during practice.",
