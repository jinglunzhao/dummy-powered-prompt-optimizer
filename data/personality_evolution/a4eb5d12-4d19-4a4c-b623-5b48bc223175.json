        "conversation_summary": "1) Problems discussed: Alex expressed overwhelm balancing art history coursework with starting a student club, job search anxiety, inefficient study habits for dense texts, and exhaustion from part-time museum work impacting studies. 2) Solutions offered/accepted: Coach proposed breaking club creation into steps (emailing professor), Pomodoro technique for readings, color-coded note-taking, and post-work micro-study sessions. Alex implemented all: emailed professor, tested Pomodoro with journaling, applied limited color-coding to Impressionism notes, and scheduled 20-min post-work reviews. 3) Student's response: Initially nervous but became increasingly engaged - took initiative at museum (researching artwork history with docents), committed to internship research, and adopted accountability systems (check-ins, progress journal). 4) Evidence of progress: Completed first club-creation step, developed customized study system (Pomodoro + color-coding), transformed museum job into learning opportunity, shifted from overwhelmed statements to proactive planning ('Thursday can't come fast enough'), and demonstrated visible confidence growth through body language and concrete actions.",

        "conversation_summary": "Alex discussed 1) overwhelming job anxiety manifesting as internship application paralysis, 2) exhaustion preventing post-work studying, and 3) difficulty retaining dense art theory. Solutions offered included micro-studying (20-30 min blocks after work), sending imperfect internship applications, strategic color-coding, and leveraging museum downtime for learning. Alex accepted all solutions, demonstrated by immediately implementing work-study integration ('reviewing Monet prints during inventory'), sending the internship email despite anxiety ('clicked send before overthink'), testing color-coding on Impressionism artists, and scheduling concrete check-ins. Progress is evident through reduced avoidance (email sent), new habit formation (scheduled study blocks), successful networking initiation (docent conversation about painting crack history), and self-aware recognition of growing confidence ('shoulders look less tense').",
