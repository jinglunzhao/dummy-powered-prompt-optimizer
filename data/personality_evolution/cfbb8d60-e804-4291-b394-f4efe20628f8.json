Solutions offered/accepted: 1) Using intentional pauses during interviews to reframe silence. 2) Starting with low-stakes leadership (coffee hour coordination). 3) Reframing nervousness as normal and using humor to cope. Student's response to solutions: Positive engagement, willingness to practice, and immediate application of techniques (e.g., role-playing coffee hour scenarios). Evidence of progress/improvement: Student demonstrated reduced anxiety through laughter, planning to coordinate coffee hour, and expressing confidence in trying new techniques.",

She expressed enthusiasm for baby steps and showed reduced anxiety by the end. 4) Evidence of progress/improvement: Lisa identified practical tools (hydration, reframing), successfully practiced a networking conversation, and left the conversation with a plan to apply these strategies ('Time to go annotate my *how to human* notes!').",
