Solutions offered/accepted: 1) Testing the org idea casually with 2-3 classmates over coffee, 2) Using bullet points for presentations and practicing, 3) Recruiting a co-founder for the org, 4) Requesting a buddy system and pre-departure meetups for study abroad. Student's response to solutions: Positive, agreed to text friends and email study abroad office, expressed gratitude for the support. Evidence of progress/improvement: Student has clear action items (texting friends, emailing study abroad office) and feels more confident about taking small steps.",
