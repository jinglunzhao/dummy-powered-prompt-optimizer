Solutions offered: 1) Potato visualization + timed practice for presentations, 2) Breaking math into song/dance segments, 3) Humorous conflict resolution (sticky notes). Lisa initially resisted ('eye-rolling') but accepted solutions through humor negotiation ('boba bribes'). Progress evidenced by completing multiple presentation practices, solving calculus problems after breakthrough ('enjoying math?!'), using improv to navigate campus politics, and initiating follow-up plans. Defensive sarcasm transformed into collaborative problem-solving.",
