Solutions offered/accepted: Start small with social interactions, conduct mock interviews, and practice personal statements out loud. Student's response to solutions: Initially hesitant but agreed to try mock interviews and practice social interactions, planned to film a practice monologue, and considered revising the personal statement with a vulnerable line. Evidence of progress/improvement: Riley showed willingness to engage with solutions, planned concrete steps for practice, and demonstrated reduced anxiety by the end of the conversation.",
