        "conversation_summary": "Problems discussed: Zachary expressed feeling overwhelmed by balancing coursework, social life, and side projects (student org and coding). He also mentioned struggling with time management and finding a mentor. Solutions offered/accepted: The AI Coach suggested time-blocking for better scheduling, breaking down the student org into smaller steps, dedicating specific time for coding, and reaching out to a professor for mentorship. Zachary responded positively, agreeing to try time-blocking and reaching out to a classmate about the org. He also expressed openness to contacting a professor. Evidence of progress/improvement: Zachary committed to mapping out his next three days, initiating contact with a classmate, and felt lighter and more optimistic after the conversation.",
