Gregory responded positively, agreeing to draft the email, lurk near bulletin boards, and start a 'win log'. Evidence of progress/improvement: Gregory committed to taking these actions and showed reduced anxiety by the end of the conversation, as indicated by his willingness to follow through and his positive reaction to the 'win log' idea.",

Student's response to solutions: Gregory found the strategies helpful, particularly the idea of arriving early and leaning into the unique aspects of his research. He practiced his pitch and received positive feedback, showing readiness to apply these techniques.
