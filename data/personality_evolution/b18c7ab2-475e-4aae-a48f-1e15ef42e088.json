        "conversation_summary": "Gregory discussed severe anxiety about networking, specifically emailing Professor Chen. Solutions included: 1) Structured email template focusing on specific research questions 2) Framing inexperience as intellectual curiosity 3) Mock interview preparation. Gregory implemented solutions by sending a tailored email and practicing responses. Progress evidence: He sent the email despite panic, connected coursework to creative research (coffee thermodynamics), and acknowledged needing presentation practice. Though still anxious, he demonstrated increased initiative and problem-solving engagement.",
