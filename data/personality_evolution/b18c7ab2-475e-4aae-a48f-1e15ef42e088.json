Solutions offered/accepted: The AI Coach suggested attending events for just 10 minutes, using a scripted opener to approach professors, preparing an exit line, and accepting hoodies as appropriate attire. Student's response to solutions: Gregory agreed to try the 10-minute approach, practice the script, and adopt a more positive mindset towards potential rejection. Evidence of progress/improvement: Gregory's willingness to attend the next mixer and practice the script shows reduced anxiety and increased confidence in networking.",
