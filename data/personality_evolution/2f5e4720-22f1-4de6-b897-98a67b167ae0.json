For presentations, practicing with smaller groups and focusing on expertise was recommended. 3) Student's response to solutions: Gregory responded positively, refining questions, planning to practice with his roommate, and using sticky notes in his portfolio. 4) Evidence of progress/improvement: Gregory felt less terrified, more prepared, and confident about not bombing the career fair, showing significant reduction in anxiety.",
