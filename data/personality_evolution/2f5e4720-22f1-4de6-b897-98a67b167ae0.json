Solutions offered included practicing public speaking in lower-stakes settings like study groups, attending an ACM workshop on technical communication, and exploring Toastmasters. Gregory responded positively, agreeing to attend the workshop despite it being after his midterm, and scheduled a debrief with the coach. Evidence of progress includes his willingness to face his fear of public speaking and his proactive approach to improving his skills for grad school.",

Solutions offered included starting with low-stakes 'micro-networking,' practicing with self-recordings, and using quirky questions to steer conversations. Gregory responded positively, successfully practicing a mock networking scenario and demonstrating improved confidence and conversation skills. Evidence of progress includes his ability to pivot conversations humorously and effectively, and his readiness to apply these strategies in real networking events.",
