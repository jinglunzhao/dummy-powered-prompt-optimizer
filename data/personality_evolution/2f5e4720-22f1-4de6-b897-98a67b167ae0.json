        "conversation_summary": "Gregory discussed career indecision (AI vs. cybersecurity), financial avoidance regarding loans, and mentor outreach anxiety. Solutions offered included: 1) Joint financial aid office visit with pre-prepared questions 2) Immediate professor email about research opportunities 3) Structured mentor question drafting. Gregory demonstrated significant progress by instantly sending the professor email during the conversation, scheduling a concrete financial aid appointment with coach support (Thursday 2pm), and acknowledging his avoidance patterns. His enthusiastic engagement with machine learning projects indicates strong career passion, while his immediate action on solutions shows improved self-efficacy in addressing previously avoided tasks.",
