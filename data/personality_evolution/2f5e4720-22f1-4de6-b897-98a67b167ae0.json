        "conversation_summary": "Gregory discussed 1) Stress about student loans affecting academic focus, 2) Anxiety about contacting Professor Chen for mentorship, and 3) Scheduling conflict between financial workshop and study group. Solutions included: structured email templates for professors, alternatives for accessing financial workshop content, and strategies to reduce perfectionism. Gregory responded positively by immediately sending emails to two professors, volunteering for future workshops, and creating an action plan. Evidence of progress includes sending professional emails without excessive editing, implementing email management techniques, and committing to approach Dr. Chen in person with prepared talking points.",
