He also created innovative stress-management systems ('Wasabi Wellness Infographic') and networking strategies ('dumpling diplomacy'). 4) PROGRESS: Demonstrated significant initiative by prototyping training games, storyboarding videos, developing cross-cultural networking protocols, and creating campus-wide stress management tools - showing reduced anxiety through creative engagement and solution ownership.",
