Solutions offered included practicing presentations in smaller steps (recording self, using tutoring center) and preparing conversation starters/exit strategies for networking. Zachary positively responded by committing to three practice recordings and planning to try exit strategies at a biology club mixer. Evidence of progress includes scheduled practice sessions and a plan to utilize campus resources.",
