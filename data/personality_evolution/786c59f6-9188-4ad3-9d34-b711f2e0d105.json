Solutions offered/accepted: The AI Coach suggested sitting in different spots in lecture halls, time-blocking for stress management, and grounding techniques like box breathing. Zachary accepted the suggestion to join debate club workshops and signed up for a low-pressure STEM diversity council lightning talk on marine biology. Student's response to solutions: Zachary showed enthusiasm for the concrete steps, agreeing to connect with debate club VP Rachel and committing to the lightning talk. Evidence of progress/improvement: Zachary's willingness to sign up for public speaking opportunities and use grounding techniques indicates reduced anxiety and proactive steps toward confidence-building.",
