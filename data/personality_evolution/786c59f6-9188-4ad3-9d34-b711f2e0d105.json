        "conversation_summary": "Zachary discussed feeling overwhelmed with balancing classes, networking, and social situations, particularly in large lecture halls and crowded dining halls. Solutions offered included joining Toastmasters for public speaking, adjusting seating and preparation for lecture halls, changing dining hall schedule, and implementing time-blocking for better time management. Zachary responded positively, planning to attend a Toastmasters meeting, adjust dining hall timing, and start time-blocking. Evidence of progress includes his proactive steps to address these challenges and his expressed feeling that the situation feels more manageable.",

Solutions offered/accepted: Start small by speaking in lab sections, attend debate club meetings, use office hours as a low-pressure way to engage, and recognize that peers are less judgmental than feared. Student's response to solutions: Zachary was visibly relieved, accepted the strategies, and made concrete plans to implement them (starting with lab sections and debate club). Evidence of progress/improvement: Zachary left with lighter shoulders, acknowledged overestimating peer judgment, and committed to actionable steps with a follow-up plan.",
