        "conversation_summary": "Jamie expressed intense anxiety about networking/job searches, specifically fearing LinkedIn outreach. The coach provided concrete scripts and behavioral strategies (e.g., time-limited tasks, reward systems). Jamie implemented these by sending 2 alumni messages despite physical anxiety, demonstrating significant follow-through. Later exchanges revealed procrastination/time management struggles during late-night coding, with the coach reframing hydration/breaks as 'system maintenance.' Jamie showed progress by negotiating hydration compromises and physically approaching the CS club. Crucially, Jamie transformed avoidance into creative action by linking a QR code to their resume and conceptualizing a coding project ('donut visualizer'), indicating improved initiative. Anxiety decreased from 9â†’7.5 through executed micro-actions and cognitive reframing.",
