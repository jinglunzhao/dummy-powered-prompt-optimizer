Solutions offered/accepted: The AI Coach suggested grounding techniques, scripting a recovery phrase, and practicing with a supportive peer (Maya).

Evidence of progress/improvement: Casey's shoulders relaxed, she smiled slightly, and committed to taking concrete steps (texting Maya, using a notecard) to address her anxiety.",
