The coach offered: 1) Pomodoro technique (25-min sessions), 2) Skill integration (using Python for journalism datasets), and 3) Scheduled Saturday sessions.

This culminated in pitching a tech-mental health article to the school paper and applying to an NPR internship despite rejection fears. Key evidence: Created functional Python programs, published article with vulnerable byline, applied to competitive internship using coach's \"progress > perfection\" framework, and transitioned from hesitant typing to confident pitching.",
