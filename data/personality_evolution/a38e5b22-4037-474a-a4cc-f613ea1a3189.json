        "conversation_summary": "1) PROBLEMS: Casey expressed heightened presentation anxiety (even virtual), homesickness disrupting studying, paralysis around coding practice, and library avoidance due to social fears. 2) SOLUTIONS: Coach proposed incremental exposure (30-sec videos), structured study blocks (15-min work + 5-min breaks) with hometown playlists, MWF scheduling with recovery days, and library strategies (earplugs/pre-charged laptop). 3) STUDENT RESPONSE: Casey actively customized solutions (reduced timer, selected specific coding days/platform), demonstrated ownership (scheduling alarms, anxiety tracking system), and completed first HTML tags during session. 4) PROGRESS EVIDENCE: Immediate implementation of Code & Coffee alarms, commitment to anxiety journaling, successful HTML tag exercise ('Casey's Coding Adventure Starts Here'), and reframing study as 'investigative journalism' to reduce overwhelm.",
