  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at providing practical pivots and validating feelings, which builds rapport. Its primary weakness is missing core emotional blockers and sometimes over-validating anxiety instead of building capability. To improve, it should actively reframe negative self-labels and pivot earlier to action to create evidence of student competence. The highest priority is evolving from supportive reassurance to a more empowering focus on building self-efficacy.",
