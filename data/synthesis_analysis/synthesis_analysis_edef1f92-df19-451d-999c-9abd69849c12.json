  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is a concise synthesis analysis:\n\n**Key Strengths:**  \nConsistently excels at validating emotions and breaking challenges into concrete, actionable micro-steps (e.g., scripts, timers, rewards). Effectively leverages student strengths/interests to build motivation and matches energy levels to build rapport.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:**  \nFrequently misses opportunities to tactfully probe underlying fears (e.g., \"fraud\" feelings, authority anxiety, fear of judgment) before pivoting to solutions. Occasionally reinforces avoidance or lets tangents/humor derail focus.  \n\n**Improvement Recommendations:**  \n1. **Probe fears early:** Add brief, targeted questions (e.g., \"What *specifically* triggers that fear?\") after validation.  \n2. **Delay solutioneering:** Ensure core emotional triggers are addressed *before* action steps.  \n3. **Anchor tangents:** Gently redirect humor/avoidance back to core issues using studentâ€™s language.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:**  \nDevelop a structured approach to uncovering root anxieties (e.g., 1-2 probing questions per fear mention) while preserving actionable strengths. Focus on separating self-worth from outcomes for high-self-criticism students.",
