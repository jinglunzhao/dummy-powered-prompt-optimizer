  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective use of humor to normalize discomfort, leveraging past successes, and providing concrete, tailored tools (scripts, anchors, micro-steps) that align with individual strengths and anxiety levels.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Delayed exploration of specific triggers (e.g., environmental, social) and learning preferences, missing opportunities for earlier customization.  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively clarify context (e.g., \"What exactly triggers your freeze?\") and learning styles upfront. Embed escape plans and physical hacks earlier in conversations.  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Sharper trigger identification, faster personalization, and gamification (\"small wins\") to build momentum, especially for high-anxiety students.",
