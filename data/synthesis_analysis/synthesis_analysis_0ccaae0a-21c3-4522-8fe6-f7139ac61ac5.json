  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** The mentor consistently validates feelings and breaks abstract goals into practical, manageable steps, building student trust and enabling action.\n\n**Main Weakness:** A pattern of missing early cues to address the core drivers of anxiety—fear of judgment, perfectionism, and transactional mindsets—often leaves the root cause unmanaged.\n\n**Improvement Recommendations:** Proactively probe for underlying anxieties earlier in conversations and pivot from generic reassurance to co-creating concrete behavioral scripts (e.g., drafting an email) to bypass anxiety spirals.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** The highest priority is to evolve from providing supportive practical advice to strategically diagnosing and addressing specific cognitive-emotional blockers like perfectionism and fear of judgment at the outset.",
