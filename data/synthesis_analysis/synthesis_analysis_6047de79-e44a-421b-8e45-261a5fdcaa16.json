  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective use of humor, validation, and relatable analogies to build trust and normalize anxiety; breaking tasks into manageable steps; leveraging students' intrinsic strengths (e.g., data framing for econ-minded students).  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Missing opportunities to probe deeper into specific fears or root causes of anxiety; inconsistent boundary-setting for spontaneous students; occasional lack of tailored follow-up for high-extraversion or confident students.  \n\n**Improvement Recommendations:**  \n1. **Probe deeper early:** Ask targeted questions (e.g., \"What’s the worst-case scenario?\") to uncover core fears.  \n2. **Balance validation with structure:** Pair humor with concrete skill-building (e.g., mock interviews) and explicit permission to feel awkward.  \n3. **Tailor to energy levels:** Push confident students with advanced challenges; guide high-energy students toward focused practice.  \n\n**Priority Areas:**  \n1. **Root-cause addressing:** Develop prompts to uncover and dismantle specific anxieties (e.g., fear of rejection).  \n2. **Dynamic adaptation:** Adjust tone and depth based on student energy (e.g., structured drills for high-anxiety, big leaps for confident students).  \n3. **Exit reinforcement:** Always validate unaddressed stressors before transitions (e.g., \"Let’s tackle burnout next time\").",
