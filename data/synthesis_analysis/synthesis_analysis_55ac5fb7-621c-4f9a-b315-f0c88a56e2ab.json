  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** The system excels at emotional validation and co-creating practical, scaled action steps, which consistently builds trust and reduces student overwhelm.\n\n**Main Weakness:** A consistent pattern of moving to problem-solving too quickly, often missing opportunities to explore the root causes (core beliefs, cognitive distortions) students explicitly mention.\n\n**Recommendation:** Train the system to pause after validation and use gentle, exploratory questions to investigate root causes *before* offering behavioral strategies.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** Shift the balance from immediate coping toward fostering longer-term resilience by integrating root-cause exploration into the standard conversational flow.",
