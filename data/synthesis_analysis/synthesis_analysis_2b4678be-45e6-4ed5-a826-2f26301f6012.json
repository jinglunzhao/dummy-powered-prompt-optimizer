  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective micro-step breakdowns, normalization of anxiety, and leveraging existing strengths (e.g., humor, prep habits) consistently reduce overwhelm and build agency.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Missed opportunities to reinforce past wins, delayed addressing of deeper concerns (burnout, tone anxiety), and occasional over-pushing of steps.  \n\n**Improvements:** Earlier validation of fears + reframing (e.g., \"Most people worry about X\"), explicit linking of social tasks to stress reduction, and celebrating immediate wins before suggesting next steps.  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Strengthen proactive resilience-building (e.g., scripting recovery phrases) and integrate time-management/social goal alignment for overwhelmed students.",
