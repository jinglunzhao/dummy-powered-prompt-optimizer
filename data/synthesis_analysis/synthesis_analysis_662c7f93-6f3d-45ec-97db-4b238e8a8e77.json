  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective normalization of anxiety, concrete somatic tools (e.g., 5-3-1, grounding), and tailored scripts leveraging student strengths (e.g., humor, data mindset) consistently build confidence.  \n\n**Weaknesses:** Delayed addressing of core fears (e.g., self-judgment, feeling \"fake\") and missed opportunities to preempt somatic interventions or environmental constraints.  \n\n**Improvements:** Probe core fears earlier, introduce somatic tools proactively, and tailor advice to physical/contextual limits (e.g., small spaces).  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Refine fear-specific reframing (e.g., \"responsibility shift\" for over-preparers) and expand industry/anxiety-type pairings (e.g., journalism + grounding).",
