  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective validation, breaking challenges into micro-steps, and pairing cognitive reframing (\"Whatâ€™s the evidence?\") with actionable tools (scripts, breathing) consistently engage students.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed probing of deeper fears (e.g., judgment, perfectionism) and missed opportunities to address somatic symptoms (shaky voice) or unresolved concerns (networking, time management).  \n\n**Improvement Recommendations:**  \n1. **Probe root fears earlier** (e.g., \"Why does X feel like failure?\") before skill-building.  \n2. **Integrate somatic tools** (grounding techniques) for physical anxiety.  \n3. **Address all raised concerns** to prevent unresolved issues.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Balance tactical steps with *timely* exploration of cognitive distortions and self-judgment, especially for high-anxiety students.",
