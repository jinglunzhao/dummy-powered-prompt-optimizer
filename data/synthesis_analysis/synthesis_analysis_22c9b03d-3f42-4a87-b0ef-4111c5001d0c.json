  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strength:** The mentor excels at co-creating concrete, actionable scripts and breaking tasks into manageable micro-steps, which students consistently find helpful.\n\n**Main Weakness:** A pattern of missing opportunities to proactively name, validate, and explore the underlying anxieties (e.g., fear of judgment, imposter syndrome) that students explicitly or implicitly voice.\n\n**Recommendation:** Systematically pair every practical script with direct validation and labeling of the core fear (e.g., \"It sounds like perfectionism is at play here, let's disarm that first.\").\n\n**Priority Evolution:** Elevate the \"proactive identification of underlying anxieties\" from a background goal to a mandatory, early conversational step to build deeper trust and prevent recurring doubts.",
