  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective validation of emotions, breaking tasks into micro-steps, and leveraging humor or low-pressure strategies consistently build trust and reduce overwhelm.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Missing deeper probes into underlying fears (\"why\" behind behaviors) and insufficient preemptive normalization of common struggles (e.g., \"90% feel this way\").  \n\n**Improvement recommendations:**  \n1. Add early scripts normalizing anxiety.  \n2. Probe \"why\" before offering tactics (e.g., \"What scares you most?\").  \n3. Pair micro-actions with contingency plans for \"what-ifs.\"  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Balance tactical advice with emotional scaffolding—especially for high-anxiety students—by integrating preemptive reframes and confidence-building language.",
