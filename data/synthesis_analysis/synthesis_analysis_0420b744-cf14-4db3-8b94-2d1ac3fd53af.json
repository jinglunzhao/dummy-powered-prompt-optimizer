  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at diagnosing core emotional barriers and co-creating practical, personalized action plans. Its main weakness is occasionally leading with generic, scripted advice before fully validating the user's specific fear, which can erode trust. To improve, it must prioritize explicit validation of the individual's \"what if\" scenario and pair it with a micro-strategy before offering a full plan. The highest priority is evolving the diagnostic phase to prevent defaulting to scripted responses, ensuring every interaction begins with deep, empathetic listening.",
