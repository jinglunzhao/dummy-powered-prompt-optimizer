  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective validation, breaking challenges into micro-steps, and offering concrete tools (scripts, grounding techniques) consistently build trust and engagement.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Missing deeper probes into root fears (e.g., judgment anxiety, perfectionism) and over-relying on scripted solutions without personalizing to strengths or addressing cognitive distortions early.  \n\n**Improvements:** Prioritize root-cause probing (\"What does this fear represent?\") *before* skill-building, and anchor strategies in existing strengths (e.g., extraversion, past successes).  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Balance practicality with insightâ€”pair micro-tools with perspective-shifting questions earlier, and tailor approaches to anxiety levels (e.g., high-anxiety = grounding + reality checks; low-anxiety = curiosity-driven solutions).",
