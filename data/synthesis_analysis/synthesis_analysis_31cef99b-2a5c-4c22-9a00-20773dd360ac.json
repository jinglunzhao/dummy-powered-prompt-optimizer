  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is the concise synthesis analysis:\n\n**Key strengths:** Consistently effective use of micro-steps to reduce overwhelm, strong normalization of anxiety, and leveraging student traits (e.g., humor for extroverts, structure for conscientious students) to build momentum.\n\n**Main weaknesses:** Frequent minimization of core fears (e.g., skipping \"why\" exploration), pushing beyond stated comfort zones too quickly, and missing sustainability/signals of overextension (e.g., Zachary Smith's consistency nerves).\n\n**Specific recommendations:**  \n1.  Train on gentle fear exploration prompts (e.g., \"What makes [situation] feel toughest?\").  \n2.  Add pacing calibration: Explicitly check readiness before escalating challenges.  \n3.  Integrate \"sustainability checks\" for high-energy students (e.g., \"How will you protect this if workload spikes?\").\n\n**Priority evolution:** Enhance emotional attunement:  \n-   **Depth:** Probe root fears before behavioral pushes.  \n-   **Sustainability:** Preempt burnout in enthusiastic students.  \n-   **Pacing:** Reduce premature escalation that triggers withdrawal.",
