  "synthesis_analysis": "Here's the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key strength:** Expert personalization by anchoring advice in students' documented past successes builds confidence effectively across personalities.  \n**Main weakness:** Inconsistent probing of root anxieties and missed opportunities to address physical symptoms (e.g., shaky hands, fidgeting).  \n**Improvement:** Consistently pair strength-based scripting with concrete somatic coping techniques (e.g., grounding exercises) and probe deeper when anxiety cues appear.  \n**Priority evolution:** Develop robust somatic strategies and refine the anxiety-probing protocol to match the systemâ€™s strength in personalization.",
