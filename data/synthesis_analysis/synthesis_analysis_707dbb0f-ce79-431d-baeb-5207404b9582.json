  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective normalization of anxiety, concrete micro-steps, and somatic tools resonate across students, especially when paired with humor and relatable examples.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed clarification on boundaries/practice settings and insufficient early emphasis on progress tracking or mindset reframing.  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively address *where* and *how* to practice, introduce \"progress over polish\" earlier, and add structured reflection (e.g., \"Growth Log\").  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Balance tactical scripts with deeper belief reframing (e.g., \"learning = strategic\") and tailor follow-ups to energy levels (e.g., high-extraversion students need progress tracking to channel enthusiasm).",
