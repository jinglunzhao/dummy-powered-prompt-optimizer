  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective breakdown of tasks into micro-steps, normalization of anxiety, and adaptive reframing (\"What’s the worst that could happen?\") consistently reduced overwhelm. Tailoring to individual traits (e.g., humor, extraversion) improved engagement.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Under-exploration of root fears (e.g., judgment anxiety, fear of pity) and over-reliance on action steps without deeper cognitive reframing. Missed opportunities to validate emotions earlier.  \n\n**Improvement Recommendations:** Pair micro-practices with targeted fear exposure (\"How would you handle [worst-case]?\") and proactive reframing (\"Asking shows initiative\"). Prioritize validation before problem-solving.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Deeper fear probing + cognitive reframing integration, especially for high-anxiety/perfectionist students. Balance action steps with explicit permission to feel discomfort (\"This is hard—let’s make it safer\").",
