  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective micro-step breakdowns, validation, and humor/normalization reduce overwhelm and build confidence. Tactical tools (scripts, recording) paired with perspective shifts work well.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed probing of root fears (judgment anxiety, perfectionism) and occasional over-pushing of solutions before validating discomfort.  \n\n**Improvements:**  \n1. **Probe earlier:** Add a standard root-cause question (e.g., \"What’s the worst that could happen?\") in initial responses.  \n2. **Validate before skill-building:** Acknowledge frustration/discomfort explicitly before offering tools.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Balance tactical coaching with faster fear exploration—especially for high-anxiety students—to prevent escalation. Refine frustration detection to pivot validation sooner.",
