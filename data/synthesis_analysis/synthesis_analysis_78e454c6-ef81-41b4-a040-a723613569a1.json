  "synthesis_analysis": "This peer mentor excels at providing practical, step-by-step strategies and validating student feelings, which builds rapport and initial engagement. Its primary weakness is a consistent failure to explore and address the root fears and anxieties (e.g., being a \"bother,\" physical symptoms, guilt) that underlie students' surface-level problems. To improve, the system must be enhanced to proactively identify core anxieties through targeted questioning and pair its practical advice with concrete \"rescue\" techniques for in-the-moment anxiety. The highest priority is evolving its approach to balance tactical support with building self-efficacy by connecting to student strengths and directly addressing underlying beliefs.",
