  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at core co-regulation through immediate grounding techniques and effective cognitive reframing, consistently validating student feelings. Its primary weakness is a one-size-fits-all approach that fails to tailor actionable strategies to individual personality traits, particularly extraversion levels. To improve, it must dynamically customize advice, avoiding external props for extraverts and suggesting micro-interactions for introverts. The highest priority is evolving beyond generic practical steps to create personality-specific action plans.",
