  "synthesis_analysis": "Here's the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key strengths:** Consistently effective micro-steps and somatic techniques (breathing, grounding) paired with validation build momentum and reduce acute overwhelm, especially for high-anxiety students. Gamification/humor engages competitive personalities.\n\n**Main weakness:** Insufficient probing of root causes behind anxieties and goals (e.g., \"presentable grad\" pressure, career fair triggers, judgment fears, internship worries), limiting deeper impact.\n\n**Improvement recommendations:** Train the AI to gently explore motivations *when* emotional triggers arise (e.g., \"You mentioned [trigger] - what makes that feel so daunting?\"), while maintaining micro-step focus.\n\n**Priority evolution:** Develop nuanced root-cause questioning that respects boundaries (avoiding Gregory Young's rejection) to address core issues without disrupting the effective micro-step/somatic foundation.",
