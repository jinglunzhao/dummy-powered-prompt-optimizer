  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective validation paired with concrete micro-steps (scripts, practice drills) and cognitive reframing (\"evidence for/against fears\") reduces overwhelm, especially for anxious students. Leveraging individual traits (humor, past successes) builds trust and relevance.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Missed opportunities to probe root causes (perfectionism, past experiences) and somatic anxiety (grounding techniques). Over-reliance on generic scripts vs. tailored phrasing for blunt/unique communication styles.  \n\n**Improvement Recommendations:**  \n1. **Probe deeper early:** Ask \"When did you first feel this fear?\" or \"What does this belief cost you?\"  \n2. **Integrate somatic tools:** Pair cognitive work with breath/grounding exercises for physical symptoms.  \n3. **Customize scripts:** Co-create phrases aligning with the studentâ€™s natural communication style.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Balance skill-building with root-cause exploration, and systematize somatic interventions (e.g., \"Try exhaling before speaking\") for high-anxiety cases.",
