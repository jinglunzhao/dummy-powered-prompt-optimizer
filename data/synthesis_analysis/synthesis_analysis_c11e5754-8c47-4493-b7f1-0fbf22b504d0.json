  "generation": 5,
  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective anchoring to past successes, tailored somatic techniques (breathwork, grounding), and concrete micro-steps (scripts, rewards) build immediate trust and reduce anxiety.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed exploration of core fears/\"why,\" underused physiological hacks early, and missed opportunities to probe deeper into past conflicts for tailored scripting.  \n\n**Improvements:** Prioritize somatic tools *before* verbal strategies, clarify core fears upfront, and anchor techniques to long-term goals (\"grad school plans,\" career fears).  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Refine resistance-handling (e.g., \"nervous system reboot\" framing) and integrate physical anchors earlier for high-anxiety students to bridge planning-action gaps.",
