  "synthesis_analysis": "Here's the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key strengths:** Consistently effective normalization of physical anxiety symptoms and delivery of tailored, concrete micro-steps (scripts, exposure ladders) that build immediate momentum, especially when linked to student interests (tech, art).\n\n**Main weakness:** Inconsistent pacing and integration timingâ€”pushing exercises when students show time/energy constraints (Gregory) or delaying somatic tools until *after* peak anxiety (Jamie), plus occasional minimization of distress via humor.\n\n**Improvement recommendations:** 1) Mandate explicit time/energy checks before proposing exercises, 2) Integrate somatic regulation techniques *concurrently* with behavioral micro-steps (e.g., \"feet flat\" *before* filming), 3) Systematically probe past strategy failures during setbacks (Alex).\n\n**Priority evolution:** Develop adaptive pacing protocols based on real-time cues (energy/time) and ensure *simultaneous* emotional-physical-behavioral strategy integration to prevent avoidance and solidify gains. Strengthen obstacle exploration protocols for setbacks.",
