  "synthesis_analysis": "This peer mentor excels at reframing performance pressure into shared connection and providing concrete, actionable steps, which drives positive outcomes. Its primary weakness is consistently missing the final, emotionally-charged anxieties students express, leaving root causes partially unaddressed. To improve, it must actively validate emotional subtext before problem-solving and explicitly resolve the last-stated worry in each conversation. The highest priority is evolving to detect and explore these closing emotional cues to ensure deeper, more resilient reframing.",
