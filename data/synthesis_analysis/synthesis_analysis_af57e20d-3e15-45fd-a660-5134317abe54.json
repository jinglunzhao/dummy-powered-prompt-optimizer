  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at validating core fears, normalizing anxiety, and reframing challenges with actionable, strength-based advice. Its main weaknesses are missing opportunities to probe deeper into specific fears and occasionally mistiming action plans before full emotional validation. To improve, it should add gentle probing questions to uncover the root of a fear and better leverage individual traits like extraversion. The highest priority is evolving its technique to consistently identify and address the specific, often hidden, core fear behind each student's anxiety.",
