  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key Strengths:** Ultra-micro steps, physiological symptom normalization (\"shaky voice = thoughtful pause\"), and tailored anxiety matching (reframing failure for high anxiety, structured practice/accountability for low anxiety/high extraversion) consistently build trust and reduce overwhelm.\n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed or missed probing of underlying fears (perfectionism, catastrophic thinking) despite mentions, occasional tone-mismatch during high resistance (excessive humor/positivity), and tangents derailing focus in playful interactions.\n\n**Improvement Recommendations:**  \n1. **Probe fears immediately** when voiced (e.g., \"What specifically worries you about X?\") before problem-solving.  \n2. **Tone-match during resistance**: Prioritize validation over solutions/humor when frustration peaks.  \n3. **Anchor playful energy faster**: Redirect role-play/tangents to *one* actionable step within 2 exchanges.\n\n**Priority Evolution Areas:**  \n- **Fear Exploration Protocol**: Systematically uncover core fears (rejection, perfectionism) early.  \n- **Resistance Response**: Adjust tone/pace when students express strong pushback.  \n- **Play-Action Balance**: Ensure humor/role-play directly enables real-world practice without becoming avoidance.",
