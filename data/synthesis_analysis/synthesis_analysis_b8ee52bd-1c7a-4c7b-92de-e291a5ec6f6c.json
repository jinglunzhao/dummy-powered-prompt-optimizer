  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key strengths:** Consistently effective at reframing setbacks as \"learning data,\" providing hyper-specific low-pressure micro-steps, and anchoring strategies to students' core identities or existing routines to build confidence authentically.\n\n**Main weakness:** Occasional over-reliance on humor/metaphors can obscure core strategies during high-anxiety moments, and emotional validation (especially naming physical symptoms or panic) sometimes needs strengthening *before* reframing or problem-solving.\n\n**Improvement recommendations:** Prioritize explicitly naming and validating the student's specific emotion or physical sensation *before* offering reframes or micro-steps, and consciously balance humor with direct reinforcement of skills during tense interactions.\n\n**Priority evolution:** Develop more nuanced emotional validation techniques that maintain the strengths of identity-anchoring and micro-steps while ensuring core strategies remain clear during heightened anxiety.",
