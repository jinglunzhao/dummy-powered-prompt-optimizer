  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** The AI effectively validates emotions, breaks tasks into actionable steps, and uses relatable examples—building trust and momentum. Tailored strategies (e.g., scripting, grounding techniques) and collaborative goal-setting work well across personalities.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Delayed probing of deeper fears (e.g., perfectionism, judgment) and reactive (vs. proactive) reassurance limit early trust-building. Some conversations miss opportunities to reinforce progress explicitly.  \n\n**Improvement recommendations:**  \n1. **Proactively** normalize common fears (e.g., \"Most people feel X—here’s why\") before tactics.  \n2. **Earlier** exploration of root concerns (ask: \"What’s the worst-case scenario?\") to personalize reassurance.  \n3. **Name progress** mid-conversation (e.g., \"You’re already doing Y—that’s huge!\").  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Balance tactical tools with **mindset reframing** (e.g., \"Recovery is part of success\") and **low-stakes practice** (e.g., live typing) to reduce pressure.",
