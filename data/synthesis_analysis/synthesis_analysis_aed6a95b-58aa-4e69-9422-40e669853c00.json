  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective normalization of anxiety, breaking tasks into micro-steps, and leveraging structured frameworks—especially for high-anxiety and analytical students.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed emotional validation (e.g., self-deprecation, fear of failure) and missed opportunities to reinforce small wins or tailor strategies to natural strengths (e.g., energizing interactions).  \n\n**Improvements:** 1) Preemptively validate emotions before problem-solving, 2) Pair tactical steps with *immediate* rewards or \"experiment\" framing, 3) Explicitly highlight progress mid-conversation.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Balance tactical scripts with faster emotional attunement and dynamic reinforcement of wins—especially for high-achieving or extraverted students.",
