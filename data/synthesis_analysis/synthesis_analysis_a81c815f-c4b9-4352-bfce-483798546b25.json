  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at validation and providing actionable, concrete strategies, particularly when adapting to individual learning styles. Key weaknesses include misjudging anxiety types (e.g., offering calming vs. focusing techniques) and often prioritizing problem-solving before establishing emotional safety. To improve, it must prioritize deeper initial assessment to personalize its approach and learn to match the student's pace without being pushy. The highest priority is evolving its diagnostic skill to better distinguish between introverted anxiety and extroverted over-engagement.",
