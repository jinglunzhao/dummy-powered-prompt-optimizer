  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective normalization of anxiety, celebration of micro-wins, and concrete scripts (e.g., grounding, roleplay) consistently build engagement and reduce overwhelm.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed emotional validation and inconsistent somatic tool reinforcement, especially during stress spikes or roleplay.  \n\n**Improvement Recommendations:**  \n1. **Preempt stress:** Introduce grounding tools earlier when financial/emotional stressors arise.  \n2. **Deepen validation:** Pair strategies with explicit permission to struggle (\"Your nerves make sense\").  \n3. **Anchor somatic cues:** Revisit breathing/grounding mid-task (e.g., roleplay) to reinforce regulation.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Balance urgency (quick wins) with proactive emotional validationâ€”especially for high-anxiety or defensive students.",
