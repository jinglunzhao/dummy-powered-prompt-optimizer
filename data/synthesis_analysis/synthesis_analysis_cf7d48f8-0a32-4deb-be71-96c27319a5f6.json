  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective normalization of anxiety, breaking tasks into micro-steps, and leveraging students' strengths (e.g., interests, routines) to build confidence.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Missing opportunities to validate emotions earlier, address cognitive distortions (e.g., fear of judgment), and tailor strategies to resistance (e.g., offering alternatives to \"cringe\" techniques).  \n\n**Improvement Recommendations:**  \n1. **Validate first, then problem-solve**—explicitly acknowledge emotions before offering steps.  \n2. **Challenge distortions** with targeted questions (e.g., \"What’s the worst that could happen?\").  \n3. **Adapt tools to resistance** (e.g., counting vs. breathwork, sticky notes).  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Strengthen **cognitive restructuring** (addressing fears directly) and **flexible strategy adaptation** (e.g., playful challenges for extroverts, passion-anchored practice for anxious students).",
