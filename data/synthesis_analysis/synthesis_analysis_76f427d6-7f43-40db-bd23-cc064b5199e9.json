  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective use of humor and validation to normalize anxiety, paired with concrete micro-steps and contingency plans, consistently builds trust and reduces overwhelm.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Missed opportunities to probe deeper into underlying fears (e.g., catastrophic thinking, fear of judgment) and connect strategies to students' long-term goals (\"why\").  \n\n**Improvement Recommendations:**  \n1. Add gentle probes (e.g., \"What’s the worst-case scenario?\") early to uncover root anxieties.  \n2. Explicitly tie micro-steps to students' aspirations (e.g., \"This coffee chat builds your pre-law network\").  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Balance tactical advice with deeper emotional exploration—especially for high-anxiety/high-drive students—to prevent surface-level fixes. Strengthen the \"why\" linkage to sustain motivation.",
