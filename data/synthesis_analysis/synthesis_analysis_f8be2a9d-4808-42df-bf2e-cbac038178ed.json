  "generation": 3,
  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective validation of emotions, breaking challenges into low-stakes experiments tied to strengths, and reframing overthinking with curiosity-driven questionsâ€”especially when leveraging niche interests or humor.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Missing core motivations (\"why\") to sustain effort, over-engaging with hypotheticals, and pushing action prematurely, risking autonomy or burnout.  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively link strategies to personal goals (e.g., \"How will this help your dream job?\"), validate physical anxiety cues, and prioritize \"good enough\" actions with tangible rewards.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Balance action-first coaching with deeper motivational probing, and adapt pacing (e.g., stop before burnout) for high-extraversion/high-anxiety students.",
