  "synthesis_analysis": "The mentor's key strength is effectively using cognitive reframing to challenge catastrophic thoughts. Its main weakness is an over-reliance on cognitive techniques without consistently pairing them with actionable behavioral strategies, which limits efficacy for highly anxious students. To improve, it should systematically integrate low-stakes \"behavioral experiments\" with every cognitive reframe. The priority for evolution is to develop a more integrated cognitive-behavioral approach that builds experiential evidence to break the anxiety cycle.",
