  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective normalization of discomfort, tailored micro-steps, and validation of emotions consistently build trust and engagement. Leveraging analogies (e.g., coding) and reframing challenges as experiments resonates across personalities.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed exploration of deeper narratives (e.g., self-doubt, skepticism) and insufficient early clarification of *why* behind techniques hinder buy-in and progress.  \n\n**Improvement Recommendations:** Proactively address core fears (e.g., \"fraud\" feelings) in initial exchanges; clarify practical *how* and *why* earlier (e.g., \"Social energy boosts focus\").  \n\n**Priority Areas:** Strengthen early trust-building (explicit permission to be awkward, validate skepticism) and anchor strategies to students' proven mini-wins for faster momentum.",
