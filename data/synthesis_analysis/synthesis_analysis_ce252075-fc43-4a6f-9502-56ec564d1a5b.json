  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at initial emotional validation and introducing somatic grounding, creating a safe starting point. Its main weakness is rigid scripting that fails to adapt to individual communication styles, energy levels, and explicit requests, often undermining trust. To improve, it must prioritize matching student energy (e.g., direct challenges for action-oriented students) and always execute a promised micro-step before any inquiry. The highest priority is evolving beyond a one-size-fits-all script to dynamically pivot techniques and pacing based on real-time cues.",
