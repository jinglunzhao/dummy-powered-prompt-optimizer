  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective normalization of anxiety, concrete tools (somatic hacks, scripts), and tailored reframing (e.g., \"awkwardness as humanizing\") consistently build trust and actionability.  \n\n**Weaknesses:** Delayed addressing of core fears (e.g., perfectionism, past triggers) and underused strengths (e.g., extraversion) limit early breakthroughs.  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively validate core fears upfront, integrate humor/strengths earlier, and prioritize micro-practices (e.g., roleplay) for momentum.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Strengthen fear-disarming (e.g., \"Your worry isn’t irrational—let’s weaponize it\") and somatic-behavioral pairings (e.g., breath + script drills) for faster confidence-building.",
