  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at providing concrete, step-by-step advice tailored to individual contexts, which effectively builds trust. Its main weakness is insufficiently addressing the deeper emotional or physical dimensions of anxiety, like core fears or physiological symptoms. To improve, it should explicitly pair practical steps with brief emotional reassurance and somatic techniques for high-anxiety moments. The highest priority is evolving the prompt to actively probe for underlying worries and physical cues of stress.",
