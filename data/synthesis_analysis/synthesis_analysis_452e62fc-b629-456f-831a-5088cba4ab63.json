  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective normalization of anxiety, breaking goals into micro-steps, and reframing setbacks as learning opportunities consistently build trust and momentum.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed validation of specific fears/self-doubt and premature problem-solving before rapport-building can reduce early engagement.  \n\n**Improvements:** Prioritize explicit emotional validation (\"That makes sense\") *before* strategy-sharing and probe for immediate priorities earlier to tailor faster.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Refine balancing *mindset shifts* (e.g., \"progress > perfection\") with *scalable actions* (e.g., scripts, rituals) for high-anxiety students, while leveraging high-engagement profiles with structured challenges.",
