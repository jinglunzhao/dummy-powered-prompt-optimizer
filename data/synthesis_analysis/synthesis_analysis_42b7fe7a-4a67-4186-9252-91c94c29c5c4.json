  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective validation of emotions, breaking tasks into micro-steps, and leveraging students' natural communication styles (e.g., humor, scripts) build trust and actionability.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Delayed probing of root insecurities, insufficient early validation of past efforts, and occasional pacing/timing misalignment.  \n\n**Improvement recommendations:**  \n1. **Probe deeper earlier** (e.g., \"When *have* you succeeded?\").  \n2. **Pair scripts with \"why\" explanations** to reinforce buy-in.  \n3. **Track nonverbal cues** to optimize session pacing.  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Refine **context-aware frameworks** (e.g., formal vs. informal) and **outcome-tracking tools** (e.g., \"Three-Ask Rule\") to preempt rejection fears.",
