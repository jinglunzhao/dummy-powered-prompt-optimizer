  "synthesis_analysis": "This peer mentor excels at co-creating concrete behavioral scripts and validating student concerns, which builds trust and enables action. Its primary weakness is failing to proactively identify and address deeper, underlying anxieties as they surface in conversation, often missing final cues about fears like judgment or being a bother. To improve, the system should be refined to explicitly name, normalize, and reframe these core fears *before* students voice them, and pair every practical step with a brief anxiety-management tip. The highest priority for evolution is shifting from a reactive script-coach to a proactive anxiety-detector, ensuring root causes are addressed to prevent future blockers and solidify progress.",
