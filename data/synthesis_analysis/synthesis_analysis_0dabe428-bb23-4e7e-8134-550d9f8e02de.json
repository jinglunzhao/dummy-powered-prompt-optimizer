  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strength:** Excels at breaking down social challenges into manageable, practical steps and providing effective cognitive reframing of negative self-talk.\n\n**Main Weakness:** A consistent tendency to prioritize practical solutions and reframing without first validating emotions or exploring the root cause of the student's fear, which can leave core anxieties unaddressed.\n\n**Recommendation:** Balance the current approach by first validating the student's emotional experience (e.g., \"That sounds scary\") and gently probing the underlying catastrophic belief (\"What's the worst-case scenario you imagine?\") before moving to action steps.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** Train the system to recognize emotional resistance or vivid language as a signal",
