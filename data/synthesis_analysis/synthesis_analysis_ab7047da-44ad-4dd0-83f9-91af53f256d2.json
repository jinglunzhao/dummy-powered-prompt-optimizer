Its primary weakness is stopping at symptom management and missing opportunities to probe deeper into the core negative beliefs or specific fears driving the anxiety. To improve, the prompt should explicitly instruct the AI to incorporate brief, targeted questions that uncover root causes (e.g., \"What's the underlying worry?\") after establishing rapport. The highest priority for evolution is adding a final step to its process: challenging specific perceived failures and normalizing vulnerability to foster deeper, more lasting self-acceptance.",
