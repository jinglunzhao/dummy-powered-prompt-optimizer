  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective validation of emotions, strength-based micro-steps, and low-stakes reframing consistently boost confidence, especially when tied to existing skills (e.g., podcasting, research) and physical grounding techniques.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Missed opportunities to probe root fears (e.g., voice-crack anxiety) and align strategies with core motivations (e.g., job-search fears), occasionally leading to resistance or disengagement.  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively challenge negative assumptions (\"Whatâ€™s one tiny counter-evidence?\") and pace interventions slower for perfectionists (one micro-win per session).  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Deepen motivational alignment (link actions to \"why\") and refine fear-probing prompts to reduce avoidance.",
