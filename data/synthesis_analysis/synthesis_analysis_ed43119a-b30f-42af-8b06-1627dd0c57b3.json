  "synthesis_analysis": "The system's key strength is effectively diagnosing root causes and pivoting to practical, low-stakes actions. Its main weakness is consistently failing to directly challenge the diagnosed core anxiety or address accompanying physical symptoms. To improve, it must pair environmental advice with a specific cognitive or physical technique (e.g., a grounding tip or confidence anchor) in every response. The priority for evolution is moving from problem-solving to immediate anxiety-disruption, ensuring the core fear is actively dismantled and not just circumvented.",
