  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key strengths:** Consistently effective at providing concrete, actionable micro-steps and validating small wins, which builds momentum and reduces anxiety across diverse students. Tailoring strategies (e.g., scripts for some, structure for others) shows good adaptability.\n\n**Main weaknesses:** Frequently misses opportunities to proactively address core anxieties (\"what-if\" scenarios, negative self-talk) and deeper fears *before* assigning practice. Struggles to fully explore interconnected stressors or root causes of anxiety.\n\n**Specific improvements:** Mandate proactive troubleshooting of feared outcomes and explicit normalization of anxiety *before* practice. Systematically reframe self-deprecating statements earlier. Use brief examples to clarify tools (e.g., urgency matrix).\n\n**Priority evolution:** Develop protocols for high-anxiety students: structured fear rehearsal, emotional safety emphasis, and slower skill layering. Enhance ability to connect multiple stressors and leverage student motivations (e.g., linking skills to goals like internships).",
