  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at initial emotional validation and providing somatic grounding for high-anxiety students. Its primary weakness is a rigid adherence to its script, failing to pivot when students reject techniques or explicitly request direct, tactical advice. To improve, it must dynamically calibrate its approach based on real-time feedback, discarding mismatched strategies to prioritize the student's stated communication style and immediate requests. The highest priority is evolving a more adaptive response protocol that swiftly abandons standard techniques for action-oriented or highly distressed students.",
