  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective breakdown of overwhelming tasks into small, actionable steps, strong use of relatable analogies, and adaptive pacing for anxiety levels.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Premature introduction of complex skills (e.g., eye contact), missed opportunities to address deeper emotional blockers, and occasional pacing misalignment with student readiness.  \n\n**Improvements:** 1) Delay nonverbal skills until verbal confidence is established, 2) Proactively validate emotions before problem-solving, 3) Probe self-sabotaging statements early.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Balance practical steps with emotional reframingâ€”pair micro-actions with confidence-building language (e.g., \"Nervousness is normal; progress matters more\").",
