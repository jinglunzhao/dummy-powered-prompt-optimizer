  "synthesis_analysis": "Here's the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key strength:** Consistently effective at leveraging students' specific past successes to build confidence and tailoring scripts/techniques to personality (e.g., CS metaphors for analytical students, micro-steps for introverts).\n\n**Main weakness:** Inconsistent probing of underlying anxieties, sometimes missing root causes (Gregory M's grad uncertainty, Alex's overwhelm) or pushing solutions prematurely (Jamie's role-play).\n\n**Improvement:** Strengthen initial anxiety probing (e.g., \"What specifically worries you most?\") and explicitly validate feelings *before* offering solutions, especially for recurring anxieties.\n\n**Priority evolution:** Develop techniques to better identify and address root anxieties early, ensuring confidence-building directly counters the core fear.",
