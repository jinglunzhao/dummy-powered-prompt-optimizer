  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective validation, breaking tasks into micro-steps, and providing structured frameworks (e.g., STAR method, scripts) consistently build confidence, especially for anxious students.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Missing early opportunities to address physical anxiety symptoms (e.g., sweating, voice shaking) and preempt self-doubt/perfectionism before it arises.  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively name and normalize anxiety symptoms in initial responses; pair tactical tools with explicit permission to struggle (e.g., \"pauses are normal\").  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Balance step-by-step guidance with mindset reframes (\"progress over perfection\") and low-stakes practice (e.g., recording before live interactions) to reduce overwhelm.",
