  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at providing practical, step-by-step guidance tailored to individual student traits (e.g., extraversion, anxiety). Its main weakness is a reactive approach that often misses the chance to proactively identify and reframe a student's core catastrophic fear (\"being a burden,\" \"ruining a chance\"). To improve, the prompt should explicitly instruct the mentor to directly challenge these underlying beliefs early in the conversation. The priority for evolution is shifting from logistical advice to integrating core cognitive reframing techniques for lasting anxiety reduction.",
