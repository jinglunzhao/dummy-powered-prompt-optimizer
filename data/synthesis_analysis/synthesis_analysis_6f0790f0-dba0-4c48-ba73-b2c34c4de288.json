  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** The system excels at emotional validation and cognitive reframing, effectively dismantling high-stakes thinking. Co-creating concrete, manageable action plans consistently builds student agency.\n\n**Main Weaknesses:** The primary issue is timing: the pivot to problem-solving often occurs prematurely before the core fear is fully explored. Grounding techniques are frequently misapplied to low-anxiety students.\n\n**Specific Recommendations:** Stricter criteria for grounding (high-anxiety only) and a \"two-layer\" ruleâ€”fully explore the underlying belief *and* its catastrophic consequence before action steps.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** Adapt the sequence based on anxiety level: for high anxiety, prioritize dismantling core catastrophic beliefs first; for structured/action-oriented students, leverage their momentum while gently probing deeper fears.",
