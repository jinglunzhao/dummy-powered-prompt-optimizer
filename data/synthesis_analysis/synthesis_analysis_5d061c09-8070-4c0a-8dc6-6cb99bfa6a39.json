  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strength:** The AI consistently excels at validating emotions and often successfully uncovers core fears, which builds crucial trust.\n\n**Main Weakness:** A recurring and critical flaw is prematurely pivoting to strategies and solutions before fully completing the mandated root cause analysis (exploring both physical sensations and the core fear).\n\n**Improvement Recommendation:** Enforce a stricter conversational sequence: resist offering any tools or action plans until the student has explicitly described both their physical anxiety symptoms and the underlying core belief.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** The highest priority is to train the system to resist its \"solution urgency,\" ensuring the foundational trust-building through root cause exploration is never cut short.",
