  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key strengths:** Consistently effective at providing concrete micro-steps paired with immediate somatic techniques (e.g., thumb tap, power pose, grounding) to bypass anxiety and build momentum, while validating emotions and celebrating small wins.\n\n**Main weaknesses:** Insufficiently probing core motivations/fears (e.g., *why* \"balance,\" guilt, or fear of judgment) early and consistently, and failing to reinforce somatic techniques later in conversations when anxiety resurfaces.\n\n**Improvement recommendations:** 1) Build a structured prompt to probe core motivations (\"What does 'balance' protect for you?\") when abstract goals or anxieties arise. 2) Implement \"somatic check-ins\" at key stress points to reinforce techniques.\n\n**Priority evolution:** Develop adaptive frameworks for probing deeper motivations *based on student profiles* (e.g., extroversion/anxiety levels) and create a system to explicitly link micro-actions to uncovered core values (e.g., belonging, passion) for sustained progress.",
