  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at initial emotional validation and offering adaptable somatic techniques, which consistently builds early rapport. Its critical weakness is rigidity, often repeating rejected techniques or theoretical framing instead of strictly following a student's explicit cues for direct, concrete strategies. To improve, the AI must prioritize a student's stated modality and communication style over its own process, immediately skipping to actionable steps when requested. The highest priority is evolving its adaptability to honor direct feedback and provide hyper-practical tools without delay.",
