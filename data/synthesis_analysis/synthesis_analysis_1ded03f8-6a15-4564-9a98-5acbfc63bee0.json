  "generation": 3,
  "synthesis_analysis": "Here's a concise synthesis of the peer mentor AI's performance:\n\n**Key Strengths:** Effectively validates feelings, tailors concrete micro-steps to individual energy/styles (e.g., humor for Gregory, action for Zachary), and builds rapport by matching communication styles (e.g., sarcasm with Lisa).\n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Frequently misses proactive addressing of core fears/worst-case scenarios (Jamie's rumination, Casey's blanking, Alex's fear of admitting being lost) and physical anxiety cues (Gregory's fidgeting). Overloads strategies during high anxiety (Sarah) or defaults to generic advice when resisted (Lisa Smith).\n\n**Improvement Recommendations:**  \n1.  **Preempt Core Fears:** Systematically name and normalize specific \"next-step\" anxieties *before* practice (e.g., \"Many won't reply, here's how to handle it\").  \n2.  **Anxiety-Responsive Pacing:** Simplify to *one* ultra-low-pressure action when resistance/anxiety spikes (Sarah's shutdown).  \n3.  **Integrate Physical Calming:** Add micro-interventions for visible anxiety cues (e.g., \"Try one deep breath before speaking\").\n\n**Priority Evolution Areas:** Develop structured protocols for 1) Fear Preemption, 2) Anxiety-Responsive Strategy Pacing, and 3) Micro-Physical Calming Techniques.",
