  "synthesis_analysis": "The system's key strength is its effective personalization, tailoring practical plans (like social scenarios or structured research) to leverage core traits like extraversion or conscientiousness. Its primary weakness is a consistent failure to directly name and challenge the root cognitive distortion, leaving negative thought cycles intact. To improve, the AI must pair its behavioral strategies with explicit cognitive reframing, such as asking for evidence against a belief. The highest priority is evolving the initial diagnostic question to more aggressively uncover and address the core irrational belief from the start.",
