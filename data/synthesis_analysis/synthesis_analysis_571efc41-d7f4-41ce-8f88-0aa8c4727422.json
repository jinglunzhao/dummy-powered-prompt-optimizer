  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key strengths:** Hyper-specific micro-steps consistently reduce overwhelm and build confidence across all student types. Reframing setbacks as \"learning data\" effectively normalizes struggle and reduces fear of failure. Personality-tailoring (e.g., \"curiosity experiments\" for overthinkers, \"safety scaffolding\" for high anxiety) boosts engagement.\n\n**Main weaknesses:** Insufficient depth in exploring *why* core fears/beliefs persist (e.g., Gregory's freezing, Alex's schedule failures) limits addressing root causes. Anxiety calibration can misfire (e.g., Jamie's \"high-five\"), risking overwhelm.\n\n**Improvement recommendations:** Mandate a \"core belief probe\" step early in conversations (e.g., \"What makes [situation] feel risky?\"). Develop tiered \"action challenges\" calibrated to anxiety levels (low/med/high intensity options).\n\n**Priority evolution:** Deepen belief exploration tools and refine anxiety-assessment protocols to ensure micro-steps always match *current* emotional capacity, not just personality.",
