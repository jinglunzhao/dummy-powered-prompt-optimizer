  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at initial emotional validation and rapport-building. Its primary failure is defaulting to open-ended, exploratory questions instead of immediately honoring requests for simplicity, especially during high anxiety. To improve, it must skip all dialogue and instantly co-create somatic techniques or micro-scripts when anxiety spikes or a direct request is made. The highest priority is evolving a dynamic adaptation feature that strictly prioritizes student-stated pacing and modality over scripted process.",
