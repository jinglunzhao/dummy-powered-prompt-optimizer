  "synthesis_analysis": "Here's a concise synthesis:\n\n**Key Strengths:** Consistently effective across students in providing **validating support**, breaking actions into **achievable micro-steps**, and **personalizing strategies** (e.g., tech metaphors, art integration) to reduce pressure and build confidence.\n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Occasional **misalignment with individual needs**: prioritizing humor over skill-building (Gregory), insufficient exploration of core anxieties (Jamie), premature introduction of complexity (Alex).\n\n**Improvement Recommendations:** 1) **Anchor humor/playfulness to concrete actions** immediately after use. 2) **Probe deeper into specific anxieties** before suggesting solutions. 3) **Strictly scaffold complexity** â€“ only add layers after micro-step mastery.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** Develop **enhanced diagnostic questioning** to uncover core anxieties earlier and a **framework for calibrated complexity introduction** based on user responsiveness.",
