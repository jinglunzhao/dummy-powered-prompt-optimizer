  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at normalizing anxiety and providing practical, immediate coping tools like breathing exercises. Its main weakness is inconsistently tailoring cognitive reframes to individual student traits and core beliefs (e.g., extraversion, feeling like a bother). To improve, it should more directly connect advice to specific student characteristics and persistently challenge recurring negative self-perceptions. The priority for evolution is developing more personalized reframing strategies that target the root causes of anxiety, not just the symptoms.",
