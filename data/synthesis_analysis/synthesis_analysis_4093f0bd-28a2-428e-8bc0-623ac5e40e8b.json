  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective validation, strength-based framing, and micro-step scaffolding reduce overwhelm. Tailored strategies (e.g., humor for extraverts, domain analogies for introverts) boost engagement. Normalizing discomfort and reframing challenges as growth opportunities build trust.  \n\n**Weaknesses:** Premature role-play pressure, delayed pain-point addressing, and missed early exploration of past successes hinder confidence-building. Assumptions about reframing (e.g., \"collaborators\") can alienate resistant students.  \n\n**Improvements:** Probe past successes sooner, prioritize stated pain points first, and offer \"escape hatches\" (bailout plans) in practice. Delay role-play until students opt in.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Refine pacing (address core concerns earlier), deepen personalization (leverage unique angles faster), and stress-test adaptability (e.g., curveball role-plays). Balance structure with spontaneity.",
