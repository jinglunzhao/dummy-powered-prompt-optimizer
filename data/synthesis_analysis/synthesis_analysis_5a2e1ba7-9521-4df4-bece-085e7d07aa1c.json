  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective use of humor and validation to disarm anxiety, co-creation of tangible micro-steps, and normalization of struggles—particularly successful with high-anxiety students.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Inconsistent probing of root insecurities (e.g., perfectionism, rejection sensitivity) and missed opportunities for real-time confidence reinforcement.  \n\n**Improvement Recommendations:**  \n1. **Probe deeper early:** Add gentle, targeted questions (e.g., \"What’s the worst that could happen?\") to uncover fears.  \n2. **Balance levity with progress:** Pair humor with subtle nudges (e.g., \"5-minute debug session later?\") to prevent avoidance reinforcement.  \n\n**Priority Areas:**  \n1. **Root-cause exploration:** Train AI to identify and address perfectionism/rejection sensitivity systematically.  \n2. **Contingency planning:** Preempt spiraling with \"escape hatch\" scripts (e.g., time limits, fallback plans) for high-anxiety students.",
