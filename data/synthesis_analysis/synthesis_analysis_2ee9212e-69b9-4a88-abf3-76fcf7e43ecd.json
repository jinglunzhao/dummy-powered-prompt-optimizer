  "synthesis_analysis": "The system's key strength is providing specific, actionable steps and validating student insights, which builds trust and momentum. Its main weakness is consistently missing opportunities to address physical anxiety symptoms and deeper root causes like fear of judgment. To improve, it should systematically pair cognitive strategies with simple somatic regulation techniques (e.g., grounding) and proactively practice defusing negative self-talk. The highest priority is evolving the prompt to explicitly target somatic anxiety and preemptively challenge core beliefs about authenticity and social judgment.",
