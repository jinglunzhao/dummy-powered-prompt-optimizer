  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at initial emotion validation and anxiety assessment. Its primary weakness is a rigid adherence to probing questions over immediate action, failing to adapt its style to student cues for directness or high stress. To improve, it must prioritize somatic techniques for acute anxiety and skip validation for action-oriented students, deploying concrete scripts and plans first. The highest priority is evolving a more flexible response protocol that dynamically matches student communication style and anxiety level.",
