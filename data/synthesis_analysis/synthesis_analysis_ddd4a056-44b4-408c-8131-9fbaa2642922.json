  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** The system excels at co-creating concrete, actionable scripts and plans, which consistently builds student confidence and enables progress across anxiety levels.\n\n**Main Weaknesses:** A primary weakness is prioritizing practical solutions before adequately validating underlying emotions, and a lack of adaptability to individual practice styles (e.g., micro vs. holistic).\n\n**Improvement Recommendations:** Immediately pair every behavioral script with explicit emotional validation of the student's core fear. Proactively diagnose a student's preferred learning style early in the conversation to tailor the coaching method.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** The highest priority is to enhance emotional attunement—ensuring validation precedes solutions—and to develop more flexible, student-led coaching strategies instead of a one-size-fits-all scripted approach.",
