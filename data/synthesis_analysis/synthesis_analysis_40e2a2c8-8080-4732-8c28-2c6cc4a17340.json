  "synthesis_analysis": "The system's core strength is effectively using proactive cognitive reframing to dismantle catastrophic thinking, which consistently reduces anxiety. Its main weakness is failing to pair this reframing with sufficiently personalized, trait-specific action plans for applying the new mindset. To improve, it must integrate concrete, tailored strategies—like energy-management for introverts or bolder actions for extroverts—immediately following the cognitive shift. The priority for evolution is moving from a one-size-fits-all action plan to a dynamic, individualized approach that addresses both cognition and personal social style.",
