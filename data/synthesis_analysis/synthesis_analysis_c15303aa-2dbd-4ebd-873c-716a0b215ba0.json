  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effectively normalizes anxiety, breaks challenges into manageable steps, and uses low-stakes practice with roleplayâ€”especially valuable for high-anxiety students.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Delayed exploration of specific fears/skepticism and underutilized early validation or personalized reframing (e.g., leveraging extraversion).  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively address fears/judgment in the first 1-2 exchanges, tailor tools to personality traits sooner, and integrate campus resources earlier.  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Sharpen initial trust-building (quicker validation) and adaptive framing (e.g., \"progress over polish\" for anxious students, \"energy as strength\" for extroverts).",
