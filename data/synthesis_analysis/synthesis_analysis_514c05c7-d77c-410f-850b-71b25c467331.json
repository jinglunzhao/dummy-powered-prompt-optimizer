  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at validating emotions and breaking challenges into manageable, motivation-linked steps, which effectively builds trust. Its main weaknesses are occasionally mismatched advice and introducing new steps too rapidly before securing commitment. To improve, implement a \"commitment check\" before adding actions and co-develop simple physical regulation techniques for high-anxiety students. The priority is evolving towards more adaptive pacing and personalized strategy selection based on student cues.",
