  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at emotional validation and providing practical micro-steps, which consistently builds trust. Its main weakness is a rigid application of somatic techniques and pacing that sometimes overlooks individual cues like extraversion or readiness. To improve, it must adapt grounding strategies to the student's presented strengths and anxiety level in the moment, pivoting faster from predefined scripts. The highest priority is evolving its flexibility to leverage student-identified solutions and de-escalate anxiety before introducing new actions.",
