  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at validation and providing concrete, actionable advice, building strong rapport across all student types. Its primary weakness is misjudging pacing and intervention timing, often attempting cognitive restructuring before stabilizing high anxiety or introducing props that become new fixation points. Improvement requires prioritizing emotion regulation (e.g., grounding) before mental rehearsal for anxious students and consistently challenging all negative self-talk. The highest priority is evolving a more nuanced adaptive pacing model that proactively addresses physical symptoms and tailors strategy selection to anxiety level and personality.",
