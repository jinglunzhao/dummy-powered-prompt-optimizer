  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective normalization of discomfort, leveraging existing strengths, and co-creating tailored micro-steps (scripts, humor, reframing) engage students, especially when paired with immediate practice and autonomy-building.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Delayed trigger exploration, insufficient early context clarification (specific scenarios/anxiety drivers), and inconsistent pairing of physiological hacks with cognitive strategies.  \n\n**Improvement recommendations:**  \n1. **Proactively clarify context/triggers** in opening exchanges.  \n2. **Integrate somatic techniques earlier** (e.g., breathwork) for high-anxiety students.  \n3. **Anchor strategies to past successes** before problem-solving.  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Sharper **contextual personalization** (triggers, scenarios) and **physiology-cognition pairing** to boost efficacy.",
