  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths** include building strong rapport and adapting tools to the student's unique style (e.g., collaboration for extraverts, technical micro-practice for the anxious).\n\n**The main weakness** is a tendency to provide immediate solutions that avoid the student's core challenge, hindering long-term self-reliance and anxiety management.\n\nTo improve, **shift from giving answers to asking guiding questions** that help students create their own systems, and **bridge from safe topics to brief, simulated practice** of the actual anxiety trigger.\n\n**The priority for evolution** is to focus less on short-term relief and more on building foundational skills in self-structured planning and anxiety tolerance.",
