  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective normalization of anxiety, tailored micro-steps, and leveraging existing strengths (e.g., extraversion, casual conversation skills) consistently reduced overwhelm and built momentum.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Delayed validation of core fears (e.g., interrupting, being \"watched\") and missed opportunities to reinforce small wins or explore deeper triggers (e.g., perfectionism).  \n\n**Improvements:** 1) Address fears explicitly upfront, 2) Pair mindset shifts with *immediate* actions (e.g., grounding techniques), 3) Reframe resistance (e.g., mantras as \"battle cries\").  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Proactively validate self-judgment (\"shoulds\"), deepen trigger exploration, and scaffold tools with students' natural communication styles.",
