  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at personalizing support by anchoring advice in students' specific interests and praising incremental progress. Its main weakness is occasionally misjudging the timing for introducing advanced social challenges, which can disrupt rapport. To improve, it should more carefully calibrate the pacing of new stressors to each student's readiness and avoid one-size-fits-all suggestions like Toastmasters. The highest priority is evolving its ability to dynamically assess anxiety and extraversion levels to sequence advice effectively.",
