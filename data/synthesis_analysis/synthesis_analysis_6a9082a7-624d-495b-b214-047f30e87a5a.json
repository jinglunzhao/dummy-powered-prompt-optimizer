  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective anchoring in students' existing strengths (e.g., reframing for analytical thinkers), concrete tools (somatic exercises, micro-steps), and normalization of imperfection with humor/relatability.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Delayed contextualization of past trauma/overwhelm, inconsistent pacing adjustments for time-crunched students, and occasional late introduction of somatic tools.  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively explore emotional context early, tailor pacing (e.g., skip roleplay if rushed), and front-load somatic tools for high-anxiety students.  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Strengthen trauma-informed pacing (ask \"Whatâ€™s your capacity today?\") and integrate measurable micro-goals earlier (e.g., \"3 outreach/week\").",
