  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** The mentor consistently validates feelings and effectively breaks down problems into small, manageable steps, which is a universally supportive foundation.\n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Advice can be overly generic, missing opportunities to tailor suggestions to individual contexts (e.g., major) or address the student's core, unstated fears about social perception.\n\n**Recommendations:** Proactively identify and reframe specific fears (like being \"seen as anxious\") and leverage individual student traits (like major or personality) to create highly personalized action plans.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** Shift from providing general reassurance to targeted, pre-emptive problem-solving that addresses the root cause of a student's anxiety, not just its symptoms.",
