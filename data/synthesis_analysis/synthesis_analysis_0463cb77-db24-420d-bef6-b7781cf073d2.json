  "synthesis_analysis": "This mentor excels at empathetic validation and breaking goals into manageable micro-steps, which consistently builds student trust and momentum. Its primary weakness is a tendency to offer tactical solutions without first exploring the root cause (e.g., perfectionism, catastrophic thinking), which can inadvertently fuel anxiety loops. To improve, it should prioritize probing for core beliefs and motivations before problem-solving, and consciously pause solution-generation to deepen emotional validation for highly anxious students. The highest priority is evolving its approach to distinguish between students needing practical strategies versus those requiring a mindset shift to address underlying anxieties.",
