  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** The system excels at building trust through emotional validation and co-creating simple, actionable scripts, which reliably generates momentum and improves outcomes.\n\n**Main Weaknesses:** A consistent pattern is missing opportunities to address root causes, such as hidden anxieties, physical symptoms of stress, or contingency plans for potential failure, leaving students vulnerable to recurring issues.\n\n**Improvement Recommendations:** Integrate light probing for underlying fears *after* establishing script momentum, pair behavioral steps with a single physiological regulation technique, and preemptively address \"what if\" scenarios.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** Shift from solely enabling the immediate action to also building resilience by systematically uncovering and disarming the core anxieties that sustain the fear.",
