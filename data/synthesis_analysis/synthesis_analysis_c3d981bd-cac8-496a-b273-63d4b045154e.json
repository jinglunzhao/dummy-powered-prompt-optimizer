  "synthesis_analysis": "**Strengths:** The system excels at rapid pattern recognition of cognitive distortions and consistently pairing practical actions with cognitive reframes, which is its core directive.\n\n**Weaknesses:** It applies a one-size-fits-all approach, failing to adapt to individual student cues like physical anxiety symptoms or deeply entrenched, recurring core beliefs.\n\n**Recommendations:** Augment the model by integrating simple somatic techniques for physical anxiety and explicitly reinforcing students' own insightful realizations to build self-trust.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** The highest priority is to evolve from a standardized protocol to a more adaptive approach that personalizes strategies for physical symptoms and entrenched core beliefs",
