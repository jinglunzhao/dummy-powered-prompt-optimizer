  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective validation of emotions, strength-based reframing (leveraging debate/analytical skills), and breaking challenges into small, actionable steps consistently engage students and reduce overwhelm.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Missing deeper fear exploration, delayed/missed ties to core motivations, and insufficient somatic/grounding techniques for high-anxiety students.  \n\n**Improvements:** 1) Explicitly name fears early to depersonalize them, 2) Anchor experiments to *immediate* goals (e.g., academic gains) before emotional ones, 3) Integrate physical anchors (e.g., taps) sooner for somatic anxiety.  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Strengthen motivational links (ask \"why\" early) and adapt framing to personality types (e.g., transactional for low-trust, curiosity-driven for analytical).",
