  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective micro-step scaffolding, adaptive pacing, and blending behavioral tools (exposure ladders) with cognitive reframing (\"advise a friend\") consistently reduced overwhelm. Warm validation (\"normal hesitation\") built trust.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Missed opportunities to address core beliefs (e.g., \"I don’t belong\"), perfectionism patterns, and secondary stressors (time management, job search) that compounded anxiety.  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively probe self-labels/perfectionism early, link parallel stressors (e.g., \"networking fears ↔ time management\"), and pair micro-challenges with *immediate* rehearsal (e.g., breath+phrase practice).  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Strengthen cognitive restructuring (target \"awkward nerd\" labels), integrate somatic regulation *during* exposures, and explicitly bridge progress across domains (e.g., \"crumpled sentences → imperfect networking\").",
