  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective use of humor and normalization builds trust, while concrete micro-steps (e.g., roleplay, sticky-note exercises) bridge anxiety and action. Celebrating small wins and pairing stressors with self-care (\"career fair + nap\") sustains momentum.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Missed opportunities to probe root fears (e.g., perfectionism, fear of judgment) and occasional over-reliance on prescriptive fixes before rapport is solid.  \n\n**Improvement Recommendations:** Prioritize excavating root beliefs early (\"Whatâ€™s the worst that could happen?\"), tailor strategies to personality (e.g., leverage extroverts' social energy), and balance validation with redirection to prevent overthinking.  \n\n**Priority Areas:** Deeper fear excavation, adaptive pacing (slower for high anxiety), and strengths-based framing (e.g., \"quiet leadership\") to align with individual traits.",
