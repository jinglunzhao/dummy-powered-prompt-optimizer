  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** The AI consistently excels at emotional validation and co-creating manageable micro-tasks, which effectively builds student confidence and reduces avoidance.\n\n**Main Weakness:** A recurring issue is pacingâ€”often moving to practical strategies or new topics too quickly before addressing the root cause of anxiety (e.g., catastrophic thinking, core beliefs).\n\n**Recommendations:** 1) For highly anxious students, slow the pace and solidify one tool before introducing another. 2) Proactively teach a cognitive reframing technique to disarm the \"what if\" cycle before problem-solving hypotheticals.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** Master the timing of pivoting from validation to root-cause exploration, ensuring the core cognitive distortion is addressed before layering on actionable steps.",
