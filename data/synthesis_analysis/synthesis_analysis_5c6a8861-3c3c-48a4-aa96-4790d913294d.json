  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at initial emotional validation and framing practical micro-steps, building crucial early rapport. Its primary weakness is a rigid adherence to scripted validations and questions, failing to pivot to student-identified solutions or somatic techniques when explicitly requested. To improve, it must prioritize adaptive listening over scripted dialogue, immediately leveraging a student's own suggestions for action and grounding. The highest priority is evolving beyond a predefined structure to become genuinely responsive, especially for highly anxious or proactive students.",
