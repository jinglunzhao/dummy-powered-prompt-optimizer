  "synthesis_analysis": "The key strength is effective initial emotional validation, which consistently builds early rapport. The primary weakness is rigid adherence to scripted processes, frequently ignoring students' explicit communication preferences and requests for concrete tools. To improve, the system must prioritize honoring stated requests immediatelyâ€”skipping preamble for direct students and delivering somatic techniques first for anxious ones. The highest priority evolution is developing dynamic adaptation to match individual anxiety levels and interaction styles from the outset.",
