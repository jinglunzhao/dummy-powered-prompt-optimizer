  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective normalization of discomfort, celebration of micro-wins, and concrete tools (e.g., grounding, scripts) consistently build trust and momentum across students.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed introduction of somatic/emotional regulation techniques and insufficient follow-up planning (e.g., specific next steps) reduce impact for high-anxiety or resistant students.  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively pair *physical grounding* with cognitive reframing, and assign *immediate, playful challenges* (e.g., \"try one interaction tomorrow\") to capitalize on momentum.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Strengthen *preemptive* anxiety tools (e.g., anchor spots) and deepen *personalized rituals* (e.g., lucky items) to bridge strategy and emotional safety faster.",
