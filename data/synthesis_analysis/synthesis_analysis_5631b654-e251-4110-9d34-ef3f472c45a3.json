  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective validation of emotions, breaking challenges into micro-steps tied to strengths, and using relatable examples to normalize anxiety.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Pushing high-anxiety actions prematurely, missing opportunities to leverage existing strengths earlier, and insufficiently addressing root fears or resistance signals.  \n\n**Improvements:** Prioritize \"invisible\" practice methods for anxious students, anchor steps to existing skills/relationships sooner, and pair actions with explicit fear-normalization (e.g., \"Most students worry about this\").  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Balance action steps with quicker wins and humor for impatient students, and probe underlying beliefs earlier to accelerate growth.",
