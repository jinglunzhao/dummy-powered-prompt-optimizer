  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective breakdown of challenges into micro-steps, validation of emotions, and low-pressure experimentation frameworks (\"small wins\") consistently reduce overwhelm.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Delayed probing of root fears (e.g., perfectionism, judgment) and occasional misalignment with student preferences (e.g., accountability methods).  \n\n**Improvements:** Normalize imperfection earlier (\"Voice cracks happen\"), pair scripting with exposure to silence/pauses, and validate authenticity concerns explicitly (\"Find *your* version of confident\").  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Strengthen root-cause probing (e.g., \"Whatâ€™s the worst if X happens?\") and adapt tools to individual energy/preferences (e.g., physical tension outlets for reactive students).",
