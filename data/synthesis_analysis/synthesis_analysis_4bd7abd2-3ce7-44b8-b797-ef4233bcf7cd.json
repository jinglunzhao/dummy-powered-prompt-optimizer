  "synthesis_analysis": "The system's core strength is effectively naming anxieties and pairing them with co-created behavioral scripts, which builds trust and enables action. Key weaknesses include a tendency to rush pacing, over-label anxieties with resistant students, and miss opportunities to address physical symptoms of anxiety. To improve, the system should integrate brief somatic grounding techniques, check for student buy-in on scripts, and diversify its toolkit of micro-actions. The highest priority is evolving the \"name and act\" model to include physical co-regulation and more adaptive labeling to prevent escalation.",
