  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective normalization of anxiety, tailored micro-steps, and reframing setbacks resonate across students. Playful strategies (e.g., power poses) and leveraging existing strengths (e.g., note-taking) foster engagement.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Delayed emotional validation (e.g., isolation fears) and missed early strength exploration reduce rapport. Over-reliance on generic tools (e.g., breathing) triggers dismissal.  \n\n**Improvement recommendations:** Validate emotions *before* problem-solving, probe hidden stressors sooner, and replace generic tools with gritty, student-aligned tactics (e.g., \"embrace trash drafts\").  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Faster emotional diagnosis, aggressive small-win validation, and scripting exit strategies for low-extraversion students. Balance tactical and emotional needs proactively.",
