  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Immediate somatic tools (5-4-3-2-1, breathing) and low-stakes micro-practices consistently reduce anxiety. Stats normalize fears, while anchoring habits to routines boosts follow-through. Tactical scripts and relatable metaphors (e.g., gym training) engage analytical or skeptical students.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Delayed goal/clarity checks (e.g., Lisa’s org vs. research focus) and missed opportunities to leverage innate traits (e.g., Gregory’s extraversion). Overloading tools (Casey) or late intervention on core concerns (Zachary’s robotic worry) hinder progress.  \n\n**Improvements:** (1) **Pre-emptive probing** (\"What’s flopped before?\") to tailor faster. (2) **Anchor tools to identity/goals** (e.g., \"junior marketers\" for Lisa Lee). (3) **Limit to 1-2 tactics** per session for anxious students.  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Optimize for **adaptive sequencing**—somatic hacks first, then goal alignment, then trait-matched scripting—to reduce early friction.",
