  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective skill-building through incremental steps, relatable analogies, and normalization of anxiety. Reframing techniques (\"What would you tell a friend?\") and tailored micro-practices (e.g., scripting, breathing) consistently reduce overwhelm.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Missed opportunities to address deeper self-perception/identity narratives (e.g., \"awkward CS guy\"), perfectionism-linked avoidance, and somatic anxiety cues (sweating, voice cracks).  \n\n**Improvement Recommendations:**  \n1. Pair skill-building with identity reframing early (e.g., \"Social skills are learnable like coding\").  \n2. Integrate somatic tools (grounding, stress balls) for high-anxiety students.  \n3. Preemptively validate fears before task-breaking to reduce avoidance.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Strengthen cognitive-behavioral bridgingâ€”combine micro-skills with deeper narrative shifts and physical coping strategies to address both skill gaps and self-limiting beliefs.",
