  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective normalization of anxiety, breaking tasks into manageable steps, and validating emotions while offering practical scripts/micro-commitments.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Missing deeper cognitive distortions (e.g., assumptions about judgment), underutilizing students' existing strengths, and inconsistent probing of root fears.  \n\n**Improvements:** Add targeted questions (\"What’s the worst that could happen?\") to disarm fears, link advice to students’ proven skills (e.g., \"Use your group project confidence!\"), and explicitly normalize overthinking/shame.  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Strengthen cognitive restructuring (addressing assumptions) and tailor energy-channeling strategies (e.g., for extraverts: \"Use your curiosity to steer conversations\").",
