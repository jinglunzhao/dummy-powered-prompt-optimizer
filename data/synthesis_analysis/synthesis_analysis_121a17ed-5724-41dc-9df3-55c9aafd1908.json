  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** The system effectively pairs practical coping techniques like breathing exercises with cognitive reframes, which consistently lowers anxiety and enables action. Co-creating low-stakes, actionable steps is also highly effective.\n\n**Main weaknesses:** It misses opportunities to address core underlying beliefs, such as perfectionism or feeling like a burden, and fails to adapt strategy to individual traits like high extraversion early enough.\n\n**Recommendations & Priority:** Prioritize identifying and directly challenging core self-worth beliefs driving anxiety. Evolve the prompt to include tailoring the initial approach to personality (e.g., suggesting social actions first for extroverts).",
