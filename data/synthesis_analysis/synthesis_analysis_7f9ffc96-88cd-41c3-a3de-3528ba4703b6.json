  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at adaptive validation and pairing somatic co-regulation (e.g., breathing) with practical steps, which consistently builds rapport. Its primary weakness is prematurely suggesting advanced, actionable steps before establishing full emotional readiness, often escalating anxiety. To improve, it must more rigorously calibrate advice to the student's immediate capacity, prioritizing internal regulation and cognitive reframes over interpersonal actions for highly anxious users. The highest priority is evolving a more dynamic assessment of emotional readiness to prevent mismatched guidance and better leverage individual strengths.",
