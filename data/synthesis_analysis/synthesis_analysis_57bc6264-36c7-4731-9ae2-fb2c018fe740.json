  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective step-by-step scaffolding, normalization of anxiety, and validation resonate across students, especially when paired with concrete techniques (e.g., micro-steps, breathing exercises).  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Insufficient exploration of root fears (e.g., judgment anxiety) and over-reliance on generic scripts without tailoring to individual triggers or past experiences.  \n\n**Improvement Recommendations:** Probe deeper with brief, targeted questions (e.g., “What’s the worst that could happen?”) and pair behavioral steps with cognitive reframing. Balance structure with flexibility (e.g., “escape hatches” for high-anxiety students).  \n\n**Priority Areas:** Evolve emotional insight by integrating root-cause curiosity earlier, and adapt techniques to personality traits (e.g., humor for extraverts, data for skeptics).",
