  "synthesis_analysis": "The mentor's key strength is effectively validating feelings and offering practical, scripted advice that builds trust. The primary weakness is a failure to address the underlying emotional root causes of anxiety, causing conversations to feel generic or stall. To improve, the mentor should add probing questions to explore core fears and connect advice directly to these emotional barriers. The top priority is evolving from a tip-giving role to one that facilitates deeper emotional breakthroughs.",
