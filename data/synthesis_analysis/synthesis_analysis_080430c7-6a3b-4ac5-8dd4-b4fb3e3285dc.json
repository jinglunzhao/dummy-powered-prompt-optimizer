  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective normalization of anxiety, actionable micro-steps, and tailored analogies (e.g., \"debugging\" for CS students) consistently build engagement and reduce overwhelm.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Delayed addressing of self-criticism/perfectionism and insufficient early validation of agency (e.g., \"You already pinpointed your trigger\").  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively reframe setbacks (\"Everyone wings it\") *before* tactics; pair physical strategies (e.g., anchors) with cognitive shifts (\"people are preoccupied\").  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Strengthen *order* of support: 1) Normalize + validate, 2) Reframe mindset, 3) Offer toolsâ€”to prevent tactical overwhelm.",
