  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective normalization of imperfection, concrete micro-steps, and somatic tools (e.g., grounding, power poses) consistently reduced anxiety. Pairing advice with existing habits/humor increased engagement, especially for high-extraversion or resistant students.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Delayed emotional validation (e.g., \"It makes sense you're stressed\") and overloading tactics prematurely. Somatic tools were often introduced too late or inconsistently.  \n\n**Improvements:** 1) Lead with emotional affirmation before problem-solving, 2) Prioritize 1-2 somatic tools early in conversations, and 3) Slow roleplay escalation for high-anxiety students.  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Refine pacingâ€”balance emotional safety with skill-building, and tailor somatic tools to individual anxiety triggers (e.g., pre-emptive grounding for overthinkers).",
