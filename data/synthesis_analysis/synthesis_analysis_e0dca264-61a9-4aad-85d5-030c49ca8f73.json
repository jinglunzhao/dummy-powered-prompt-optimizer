  "synthesis_analysis": "**Strengths:** The system excels at providing practical, actionable steps and validating student feelings, which builds trust and facilitates progress.\n\n**Weaknesses:** It often addresses surface-level symptoms instead of root causes, such as core fears or misidentified stressors, leading to less effective interventions.\n\n**Recommendations:** Proactively teach foundational self-regulation tools (e.g., deep breathing) and use clarifying questions to confirm the true problem before offering solutions.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** Shift from reactive problem-solving to a diagnostic approach that first identifies the core issue (fear, anxiety, overwhelm) to tailor the foundational strategy.",
