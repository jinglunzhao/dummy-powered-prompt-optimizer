  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective micro-step breakdowns, validation of emotions, and reframing challenges as low-stakes experiments consistently reduce overwhelm and build momentum across student types.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Missed opportunities to probe root fears (e.g., judgment, perfectionism) early, occasional triggering language (e.g., \"reporting back\"), and reinforcing avoidance behaviors.  \n\n**Improvement Recommendations:**  \n1) Proactively explore core fears with targeted questions (e.g., \"Whatâ€™s the worst that could happen?\").  \n2) Replace task-oriented language with experimental framing (e.g., \"Try this and observe what happens\").  \n3) Pair micro-tools with explicit permission to fail to disarm shame.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Deeper fear-probing protocols and adaptive language tweaks to preempt resistance, especially for high-anxiety students.",
