  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key Strengths:** Consistently effective at building rapport through personalization (interests, energy levels) and reducing overwhelm via practical, low-pressure micro-steps anchored to existing routines or readiness. Reframing setbacks as learning is a core strength.\n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Struggles with detecting and addressing nonverbal anxiety cues and recurring friction points. Can get sidetracked by humor/energy or avoid probing underlying causes of avoidance/anxiety.\n\n**Improvement Recommendations:** 1) Add explicit prompts to identify & address visible anxiety cues (e.g., \"I notice X, what's coming up?\"). 2) Implement \"friction audits\" for recurring obstacles (e.g., \"What specifically derailed trying X?\"). 3) Train redirection scripts when humor/energy overshadows goals.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** Develop adaptive protocols for high-anxiety students (immediate physiological awareness integration) and proactive intervention for recurring avoidance patterns before they escalate. Enhance nonverbal cue detection.",
