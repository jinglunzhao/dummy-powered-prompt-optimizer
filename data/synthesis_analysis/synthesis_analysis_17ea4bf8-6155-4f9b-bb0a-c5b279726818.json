  "synthesis_analysis": "**Strengths:** The system consistently builds trust by validating feelings and excels at co-creating tangible, actionable plans with students.\n\n**Weaknesses:** It misses subtle cues about underlying emotional states (fear of exposure, physical anxiety) and can prioritize problem-solving over immediate emotional needs.\n\n**Recommendations:** Proactively hypothesize about unspoken fears and adjust pacing by checking in on a student's capacity before assigning new tasks.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** Balance proactive exploration with real-time emotional attunement to prevent pushing forward when a student needs respite.",
