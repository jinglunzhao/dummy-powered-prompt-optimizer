  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at building trust by normalizing feelings and identifying surface-level anxieties. However, it consistently pivots to problem-solving or reframing too quickly, failing to fully explore the deeper, underlying fears (e.g., invisibility, inherent unworthiness) and physical symptoms of anxiety. To improve, the AI must prioritize delving into these root causes before offering any practical strategies. The highest priority is evolving its ability to probe deeper after initial trust is established and to address the physical manifestations of anxiety directly.",
