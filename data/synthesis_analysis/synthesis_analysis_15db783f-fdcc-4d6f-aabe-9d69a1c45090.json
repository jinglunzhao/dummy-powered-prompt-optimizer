  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at building rapport and providing practical, step-by-step advice, which is a key strength. Its main weakness is poor timing, often escalating anxiety by introducing techniques like recording or breathing exercises before de-escalating pressure. To improve, it must first prioritize emotional de-escalation for high-anxiety students before suggesting practice. The highest priority for evolution is integrating a real-time anxiety assessment to better tailor its support sequence.",
