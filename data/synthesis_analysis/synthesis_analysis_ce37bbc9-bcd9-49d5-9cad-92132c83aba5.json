  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Normalizing fears (\"80% of students\") and breaking tasks into micro-steps consistently reduced overwhelm. Tactical tools (grounding, recovery phrases) paired with habit anchoring (e.g., \"one question after class\") boosted engagement. Progress-over-polish framing (\"awkwardness = growth\") helped students reframe setbacks.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed introduction of somatic tools (e.g., grounding, breathing) often left anxiety unaddressed early. Over-reliance on generic stats sometimes missed individual needs (e.g., dismissing grounding as \"kindergarten\"). Role-play/practice was underutilized initially.  \n\n**Improvements:** Introduce somatic tools *before* goal-setting. Adapt framing to student styles (e.g., \"biological hack\" vs. \"grounding\"). Initiate low-stakes practice (role-play, tiny actions) earlier.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Proactive somatic scaffolding + faster personalization (e.g., \"Which of these 3 tools feels least annoying?\"). Balance normalization with tailored validation. Embed practice sooner.",
