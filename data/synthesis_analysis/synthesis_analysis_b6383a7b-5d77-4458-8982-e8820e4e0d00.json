  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective normalization of fears, tailored micro-steps, and proactive encouragement (e.g., humor, relatable examples) build trust and reduce pressure.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed addressing of core anxieties (e.g., reputation, burnout) and missed opportunities to reinforce progress early.  \n\n**Improvements:** Probe deeper into specific fears sooner, link social steps to existing routines/strengths, and explicitly reframe setbacks as practice.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Balance tactical tools with mindset shifts—especially for high-anxiety/extroverted students—by emphasizing *structured spontaneity* and energy-aware pacing.",
