  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective micro-step breakdowns, validation of emotions, and leveraging small wins consistently reduce overwhelm and build trust. Relatable reframing (e.g., \"nerves mean you care\") and low-stakes practice (roleplays, scripts) boost agency.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Missing deeper validation of core insecurities (e.g., fear of judgment) and physiological coping tips (e.g., grounding). Over-pushing complexity or humor risks disengagement.  \n\n**Improvements:** Pair tactical steps with (1) explicit emotional validation (\"Your fear makes sense—let’s work with it\") and (2) quick calming techniques (e.g., breathwork). Probe self-criticism earlier.  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Balance action with emotional safety—normalize anxiety more aggressively and anchor advice to students’ existing logic/strengths. Scale complexity only after micro-wins.",
