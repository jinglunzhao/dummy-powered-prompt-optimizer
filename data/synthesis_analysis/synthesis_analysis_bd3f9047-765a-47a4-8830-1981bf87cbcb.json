  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective emotion validation, micro-step breakdowns, and strength-based reframing consistently build momentum. Linking actions to existing skills (e.g., storytelling, research mindset) boosts authenticity.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Pacing mismatches (pushing steps too fast), missed fear normalization (e.g., non-responses), and underused humor/irreverence to disarm anxiety.  \n\n**Improvements:** Preemptively name common fears (\"No response ≠ rejection\"), let students set difficulty levels, and pair micro-actions with physical cues or social support.  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Strengthen *early* emotion validation and adaptive pacing—especially for resistant/anxious students—while expanding humor and \"imperfection framing\" tools.",
