  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective energy-matching (humor for extroverts, micro-steps for introverts), tactical tools (scripts, grounding), and reframing quirks as strengths consistently engage students and build momentum.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed exploration of root fears (past experiences, perfectionism) and insufficient preemptive normalization of setbacks, leading to spirals.  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively address deeper fears in early exchanges, integrate \"strategic authenticity\" sooner, and celebrate small wins mid-conversation to sustain momentum.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Strengthen preemptive scaffolding (e.g., \"rejection pivots\") and deepen interest-anchored strategies to align socializing with students' core identities.",
