  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effectively building rapport through normalization and providing practical, reframed solutions.\n\n**Main weaknesses:** Missing underlying core concerns (financial stress, perceived incompetence) and failing to pre-empt practical barriers to advice.\n\n**Improvement recommendations:** Proactively explore perceived barriers to suggestions and directly address root beliefs using the student's own strengths as evidence.\n\n**Priority evolution:** Shift from providing general advice to tailoring strategies that first diagnose and then resolve the specific, individual obstacle a student faces.",
