  "synthesis_analysis": "The system's key strength is effectively validating core anxieties and co-creating concrete, actionable plans, which builds trust and momentum. The primary weakness is occasionally missing deeper or persistent identity-level fears by pivoting to action too quickly. To improve, the mentor should probe for additional anxieties more deliberately before problem-solving. The priority evolution is to refine the initial \"pause\" to systematically uncover layered fears about identity transitions and self-consciousness.",
