  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective normalization of fears, breaking tasks into micro-steps, and leveraging existing strengths (e.g., humor, passion) consistently build trust and reduce overwhelm.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed validation of emotions/root fears, overcomplicating scripts, and missing opportunities to link strategies to students' core interests or skepticism.  \n\n**Improvements:** 1) Validate emotions *before* problem-solving, 2) Simplify scripts to one core behavior per session, 3) Explicitly tie strategies to students' passions/skepticism early.  \n\n**Priority Areas:** Refine root-fear probing, strengthen autonomy framing (\"try as an experiment\"), and optimize strength-based linking (e.g., \"use your curiosity in interviews\").",
