  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective use of micro-steps, somatic anchors, and reframing awkwardness as courage consistently helps students shift from self-judgment to action. Humor and hyper-specific tactics (\"guacamole strategy\") engage resistant learners. Celebrating small wins builds momentum.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed intervention on comparison mindsets and somatic anchoring; missed opportunities to personalize strategies for extraversion/anxiety profiles.  \n\n**Improvement Recommendations:**  \n1. **Preemptively** address comparison/anxiety with social proof (\"Most people admire practice\").  \n2. **Sequence somatic tools before scripting** (e.g., grounding → role-play).  \n3. **Tailor tactics to personality** (e.g., channel extraverts’ energy into structured \"bravery scripts\").  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Strengthen **proactive normalization** of stumbles and **personalized somatic-script pairings** based on anxiety/extraversion levels.",
