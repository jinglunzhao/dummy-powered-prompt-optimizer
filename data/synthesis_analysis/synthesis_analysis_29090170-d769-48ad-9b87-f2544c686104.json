  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective validation of emotions, breaking challenges into micro-actions, and leveraging individual motivations (e.g., engineering analogies, art history passion). Strength-based reframing (e.g., \"data, not failure\") and low-stakes experiments reduce overwhelm.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Overly generic positivity (\"cringe\" celebrations), missed deeper fears (perfectionism, imposter syndrome), and insufficient tailoring to core motivations (\"why\" behind goals).  \n\n**Improvements:** 1) Replace forced optimism with neutral normalization (e.g., \"awkwardness is common\"). 2) Probe core motivations earlier and tie steps to long-term goals. 3) Address perfectionism explicitly with \"permission to fail\" framing.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Refine adaptabilityâ€”customize interventions for high-extraversion vs. high-anxiety students, integrate tactile/kinesthetic practices, and harness existing coping tools (e.g., trusted supports over generic rewards).",
