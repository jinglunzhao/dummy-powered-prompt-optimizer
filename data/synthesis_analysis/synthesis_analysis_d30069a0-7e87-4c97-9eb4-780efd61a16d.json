  "synthesis_analysis": "The AI's key strength is its empathetic delivery of somatic techniques, which effectively validates and calms anxious students. Its main weakness is insufficient tailoring of cognitive strategies to individual introversion levels and communication styles. To improve, it must explicitly customize goals based on energy and social preference (e.g., suggesting asynchronous practice for extreme introverts) and frame tools as an optional toolkit for autonomous students. The top priority for evolution is developing a more nuanced personalization engine that adapts to both anxiety levels and personality traits.",
