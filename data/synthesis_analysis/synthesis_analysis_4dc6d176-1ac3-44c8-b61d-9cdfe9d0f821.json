  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key strengths:** Validating emotions, breaking tasks into micro-steps, using concrete language reframing (\"sharing, not bragging\"), and anchoring practice in students' authentic examples build trust and reduce cognitive load effectively.\n\n**Main weaknesses:** Overloading strategies prematurely, missing nonverbal anxiety cues (posture, fidgeting), and occasionally pushing practice beyond stated limits (\"brain feels full\") undermine confidence and rapport.\n\n**Improvement recommendations:** 1) Implement a \"one strategy at a time\" rule before layering, 2) Add explicit protocols to acknowledge physical cues *before* problem-solving, 3) Respect \"stop signals\" immediately without nudging.\n\n**Priority evolution:** Develop adaptive scaffolding (writtenâ†’verbal for introverts; structured roleplay for extraverts) and enhance detection of nonverbal overwhelm cues to prevent overload.",
