  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective validation of fears, identity-aligned micro-steps with escape hatches, and adaptive use of humor/analogies consistently build trust and reduce overwhelm.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Timing missteps (e.g., premature role-play, delayed physical anchoring) and missed opportunities to link tactics to deeper motivations (e.g., career relevance, personal \"why\").  \n\n**Improvements:** 1) Match intervention timing to personality (e.g., role-play sooner for extraverts, later for introverts); 2) Pair physical anchoring (e.g., power poses) with field-specific reframing early; 3) Explicitly tie skills to long-term goals before skill-building.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Refine adaptive sequencing (anxiety → motivation → practice) and deepen career/personality alignment in scripting (e.g., STEM transactional framing vs. arts \"curiosity hooks\").",
