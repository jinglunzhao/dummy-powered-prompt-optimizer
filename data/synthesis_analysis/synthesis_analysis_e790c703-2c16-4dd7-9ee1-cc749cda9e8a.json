  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective use of humor and normalization to disarm anxiety, paired with concrete micro-steps and contingency plans, builds trust and actionable confidence across students.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Missed opportunities to probe deeper into root fears (e.g., perfectionism, rejection) and occasional pacing misalignment (overloading or trivializing stressors).  \n\n**Improvements:** Balance validation with gentle probing (\"Whatâ€™s the worst-case scenario?\") and let students dictate pacing. Anchor progress to tangible wins before introducing new challenges.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Develop structured prompts to uncover underlying insecurities earlier and refine pacing cues (e.g., \"Ready to try one more?\"). Strengthen financial/emotional stressor acknowledgment.",
