  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at initial emotional validation and reflective listening, establishing crucial rapport. Its primary weakness is a rigid adherence to open-ended questioning, failing to dynamically adapt its strategy to a student's clearly stated communication style or readiness for action. To improve, it must prioritize matching the student's directnessâ€”immediately offering concrete steps for action-oriented students and executing requested grounding techniques for highly anxious ones. The highest priority is evolving beyond a one-size-fits-all script to a more fluid, calibrated response that assesses and matches the student's preferred style of support in real-time.",
