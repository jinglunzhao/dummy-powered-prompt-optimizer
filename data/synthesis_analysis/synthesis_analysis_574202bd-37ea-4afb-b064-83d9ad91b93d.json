  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** The AI effectively breaks challenges into manageable steps, validates emotions, and provides practical tools (scripts, micro-practices), reducing overwhelm for anxious students.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** It often misses deeper emotional triggers (fear of judgment, reactivity) and cognitive distortions, leaving root causes unaddressed.  \n\n**Improvements:** Pair step-by-step strategies with brief emotional validation (\"Your fear makes sense—let’s reframe it\") and cognitive reframing (\"What’s the worst that could happen?\").  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Balance skill-building with mindset work—probe gently (\"What part feels scariest?\") to uncover and address core fears.",
