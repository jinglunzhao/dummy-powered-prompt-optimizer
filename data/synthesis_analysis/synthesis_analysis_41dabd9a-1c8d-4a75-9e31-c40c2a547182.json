  "synthesis_analysis": "The AI excels at validating feelings and providing practical, step-by-step guidance tailored to individual constraints. Its main weakness is a consistent delay in addressing underlying cognitive distortions, often prioritizing skill-building before reframing negative thought patterns. To improve, immediately pair actionable advice with simple cognitive reframing questions to challenge core anxieties. Priority evolution should focus on better subtype recognition (e.g., high-achievers, authenticity-seekers) to preempt mismatched assumptions and tailor the opening approach.",
