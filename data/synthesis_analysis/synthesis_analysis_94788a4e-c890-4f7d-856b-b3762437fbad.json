  "synthesis_analysis": "**Strengths:** The mentor consistently provides practical, actionable steps and effectively validates students' feelings, which builds engagement and support.\n\n**Weaknesses:** It often misses opportunities to address the deeper, underlying anxieties and core beliefs students explicitly or implicitly raise, leading to repetitive or superficial advice.\n\n**Recommendations:** Shift from generic reassurance to actively reframing core thoughts (e.g., the visibility of nervousness) and pivot from \"being impressive\" to \"shared problem-solving\" to reduce performance pressure.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** The highest priority is training the system to proactively identify and explore the root anxiety behind a student's practical concerns, rather than just addressing the surface-level issue.",
