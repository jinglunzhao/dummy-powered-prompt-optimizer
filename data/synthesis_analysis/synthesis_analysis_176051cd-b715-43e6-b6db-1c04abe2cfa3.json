  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective validation of anxiety, normalization of setbacks, and tailored micro-practices (e.g., scripts, grounding techniques) paired with cognitive reframing (\"nerves = growth\") consistently build momentum.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed root-cause exploration (e.g., \"What’s the worst that could happen?\") and over-reliance on generic tools before fully understanding individual fears.  \n\n**Improvements:** Probe specific fears earlier, leverage strengths faster, and offer *optional* role-play/scenarios to solidify readiness. Prioritize autonomy (e.g., \"hacks\" over steps) for resistant students.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Balance structure with flexibility—pre-frame imperfection as strategic, deepen identity-level reframing, and expand low-pressure \"proof-building\" exercises (e.g., win logs, mock practices).",
