  "synthesis_analysis": "This peer mentor excels at reframing fears of being a burden and creating actionable steps, which builds student agency. Its primary weakness is a lack of precision in proactively identifying and dismantling the *specific* catastrophic \"worst-case scenario\" behind a student's stated fear. To improve, the system should directly probe likelihood and impact (e.g., \"What's the worst that could happen?\") before moving to action plans. The highest priority for evolution is refining its cognitive reframing to more precisely target and neutralize the core catastrophic belief in each interaction.",
