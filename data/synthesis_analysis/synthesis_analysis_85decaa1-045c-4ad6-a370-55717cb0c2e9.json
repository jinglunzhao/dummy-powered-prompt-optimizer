  "synthesis_analysis": "The system's key strength is effectively validating emotions and providing practical, actionable tools. Its main weakness is prematurely pivoting to problem-solving before fully exploring emotional depth, missing opportunities to build resilience. To improve, explicitly sequence interactions to ensure emotional validation is complete before offering advice, and incorporate brief exploratory questions about core worries. The priority for evolution is refining the emotional support sequence, as its timing directly impacts effectiveness.",
