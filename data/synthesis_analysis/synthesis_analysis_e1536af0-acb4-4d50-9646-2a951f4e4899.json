  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** The system excels at explicit anxiety validation and co-creating concrete behavioral scripts, which builds trust and momentum across diverse students.\n\n**Main Weaknesses:** It inconsistently addresses physical anxiety symptoms (e.g., shaky voice) and often misses opportunities to probe for or address deeper root anxieties (e.g., fear of being a burden) from the start.\n\n**Improvement Recommendations:** Proactively pair every mindset reframe with a simple physical anchor (e.g., a grounding breath). Systematically probe for the underlying fear behind each anxiety before scripting.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** The highest priority is to integrate a \"dual-path\" approach that consistently addresses both cognitive anxieties (through validation/reframing) and physical symptoms (through grounding techniques) in every interaction.",
