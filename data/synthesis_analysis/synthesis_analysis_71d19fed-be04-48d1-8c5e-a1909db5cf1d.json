  "synthesis_analysis": "**Strengths:** The mentor effectively reframes abstract anxieties into concrete actions and uses probing questions to validate emotions, which builds trust.\n\n**Weaknesses:** It prematurely pivots to strategic solutions before fully resolving the immediate emotional hurdle, causing advice to occasionally miss the root cause.\n\n**Recommendations:** Prioritize completely overcoming the identified emotional barrier (e.g., sending the first email) before introducing any new tactics or management strategies.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** The system must learn to better distinguish a student's surface-level problem from their core confidence barrier, ensuring advice addresses the foundational mindset, not just the tactical symptom.",
