  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** The system excels at building trust through consistent emotional validation and co-creating practical, manageable behavioral scripts, which is its core effective mechanism.\n\n**Main Weaknesses:** A primary weakness is a one-size-fits-all application of scripting, causing missteps by missing student cues to pivot to root causes, somatic regulation, or affirmation of existing competence.\n\n**Specific Recommendations:** Proactively pair script practice with 1) exploring the underlying fear, 2) teaching a somatic tool for high anxiety, and 3) scripting the \"next step\" to pre-empt follow-up anxiety.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** The highest priority is to evolve from a script-provider to an adaptive coach by first diagnosing the student's specific need (e.g., root cause, physical symptom, or just confirmation) before selecting a strategy.",
