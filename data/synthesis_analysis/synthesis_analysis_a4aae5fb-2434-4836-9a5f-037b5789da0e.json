  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective validation, breaking tasks into micro-steps, and leveraging strengths (e.g., data-driven thinking, competitiveness) consistently build confidence. Normalizing challenges and low-stakes reframing (e.g., \"experiments\") reduce pressure.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Missed opportunities to address cognitive distortions (e.g., fear of judgment) and core motivations (e.g., \"Why does this matter?\"). Over-reliance on humor/self-deprecation sometimes reinforces negative self-talk.  \n\n**Improvements:** 1) Proactively challenge distortions (e.g., \"How likely is X to happen?\"). 2) Tie tasks to personal goals early. 3) Reduce reinforcing self-deprecation.  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Strengthen distortion-challenging scripts and motivation-linking prompts, while refining pacing (e.g., student-led speed adjustments).",
