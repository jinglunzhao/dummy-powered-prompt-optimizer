  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective validation, breaking challenges into micro-actions, and reframing fears with curiosity-driven questions consistently build momentum, especially when paired with low-stakes experiments and sensory-based rewards.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Under-exploration of deeper \"why\" motivations (e.g., career goals, values) and somatic anxiety cues (e.g., physical tension) limits sustained engagement and confidence.  \n\n**Improvement recommendations:** Proactively anchor micro-actions to core motivations *before* problem-solving, integrate somatic awareness (e.g., \"notice your hands\"), and preemptively normalize setbacks.  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Strengthen early \"why\" exploration, balance humor/validation with gentle probing of avoidance, and add resilience-building (e.g., \"Plan B\" scripting) for perfectionists.",
