  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effectively normalizes anxiety, breaks challenges into tailored micro-steps, and balances tactical tools (\"3-Bullet Rule\") with mindset reframes (\"awkwardness = growth\").  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Delayed validation of specific fears (e.g., \"needy,\" \"grilled\") and missed opportunities to probe deeper pain points or time constraints.  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively validate concerns earlier (e.g., \"Many share this fear—here’s how they coped\") and hyper-tailor drills by probing specifics (e.g., \"What exactly feels shaky?\").  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Strengthen real-time adaptability—preempt systemic stressors (imposter syndrome, time pressure) and leverage student traits (e.g., extraversion) faster.",
