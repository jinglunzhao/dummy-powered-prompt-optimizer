  "synthesis_analysis": "The system's key strength is effectively reframing social fears and providing practical, actionable steps. Its primary weakness is a consistent failure to pivot from strategy to explore the student's underlying identity-level anxieties when they emerge. To improve, it must be trained to pause tactical advice and directly probe identity threats (e.g., \"Tell me more about that feeling\"). The highest priority is evolving its ability to detect and validate core self-concept fears before reinforcing process-oriented steps.",
