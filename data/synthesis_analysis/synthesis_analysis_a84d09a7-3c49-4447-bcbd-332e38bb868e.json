  "synthesis_analysis": "The mentor excels at validation and providing concrete, actionable steps, which consistently builds rapport and engagement. Key weaknesses include pacing interventions too aggressively for high-anxiety students and occasionally missing opportunities to counter negative self-talk. To improve, balance validation with gentle challenges to cognitive distortions and allow more mental rehearsal time before practice. The highest priority is refining the adaptive strategy to better match individual student traits, particularly anxiety levels and extraversion.",
