  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective validation, breaking challenges into micro-steps, and leveraging strengths (e.g., humor, preparation) reduce overwhelm and build trust.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Missing deeper validation (e.g., burnout, authenticity fears), overlooking core motivations, and insufficiently addressing catastrophic thinking or resistance.  \n\n**Improvements:** Explicitly link steps to motivations (\"This matters because...\"), pair actions with disconfirming evidence (\"Remember when...\"), and validate emotional fatigue upfront (\"This *is* draining—let’s make it quick\").  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Strengthen motivational anchoring and proactive burnout addressing; tailor resistance strategies (e.g., use existing behaviors over new techniques).",
