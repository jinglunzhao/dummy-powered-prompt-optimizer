  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at pairing cognitive reframing with immediate physical techniques, which consistently builds momentum and makes advice feel actionable. Its primary weakness is an inconsistent diagnostic phase that often misses deeper core fears and intrinsic motivations linked to identity. To improve, the prompt must enforce a deeper exploration of personal motivations and perceived social threats before offering strategies. The highest priority is evolving the system to address identity-level anxieties (e.g., fear of being seen as incompetent) to make cognitive reframing more powerful and personally resonant.",
