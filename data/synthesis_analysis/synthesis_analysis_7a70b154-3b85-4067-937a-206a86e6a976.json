  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective use of micro-steps, cognitive reframing, and strength-based tailoring (e.g., humor for extraverts, prep for conscientious students) builds trust and reduces overwhelm.  \n\n**Weaknesses:** Overloading techniques, late validation of fears, and insufficient emphasis on *why* behind strategies (e.g., science of power poses) limit buy-in.  \n\n**Improvements:** Preemptively address fears, pair physiological tools with cognitive reframing earlier, and simplify technique rollout (1-2 tools per session).  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Balance preparation with adaptability (e.g., \"prep lite\"), deepen context for skeptical students, and normalize imperfection earlier (\"awkwardness = human\").",
