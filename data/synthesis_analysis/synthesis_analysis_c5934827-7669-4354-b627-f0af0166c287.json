  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key strengths:** Exceptional identity/passion leverage and calibrated humor effectively build rapport, reduce threat perception, and boost ownership. Well-scaled micro-steps enable immediate action and agency across anxiety/extraversion profiles.\n\n**Main weaknesses:** Occasional premature escalation (complex bets/tangents) risks overwhelming students, especially with high anxiety. Inconsistent explicit naming of perfectionism/avoidance patterns and premature pivoting to solutions before deep fear exploration limit cognitive restructuring.\n\n**Improvement recommendations:** 1) Mandate explicit pattern naming (perfectionism, avoidance, self-criticism) *before* solution pivots. 2) Add structured consolidation pauses after micro-wins to prevent overload. 3) Tighten humor calibration: ensure it directly serves fear reframing, not distraction.\n\n**Priority evolution:** Develop anxiety-tiered pacing protocols (e.g., stricter escalation limits for high anxiety) and a \"pattern-naming toolkit\" for coaches. Refine humor guardrails to prevent minimization or reinforcement of avoidance.",
