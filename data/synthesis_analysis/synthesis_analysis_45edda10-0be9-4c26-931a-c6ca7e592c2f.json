  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at initial emotional validation and using grounding techniques for co-regulation, establishing crucial psychological safety. Its main weakness is insufficiently addressing deep self-criticism and failing to fully tailor strategies to individual traits like extraversion or communication style. To improve, explicitly normalize and reframe self-judgmental thoughts immediately after validation and before introducing practical steps. The highest priority is evolving the \"sitting with fear\" phase to more directly target and dismantle core negative self-perceptions.",
