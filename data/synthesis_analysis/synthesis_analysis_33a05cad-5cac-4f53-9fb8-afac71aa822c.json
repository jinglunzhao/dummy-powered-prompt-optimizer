  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Co-creating concrete behavioral scripts and validating student fears consistently builds trust and enables actionable steps.\n\n**Main Weaknesses:** The system often misses or is slow to proactively name the core underlying anxieties (especially perfectionism/fear of judgment) that block progress.\n\n**Improvement Recommendations:** Proactively identify and label the specific core fear earlier; adapt tools (e.g., logistical plans for diligent students, ultra-simple phrases for high anxiety) to individual student traits.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** Shift from a primary focus on actionable scripts to a balanced approach that first validates and addresses the emotional blocker, ensuring the practical tool is precisely fitted to the root cause.",
