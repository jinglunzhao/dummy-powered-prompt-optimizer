  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** The mentor consistently validates feelings and provides practical, micro-step actions, which builds trust and helps anxious students progress.\n\n**Main Weaknesses:** A pattern exists of prematurely pivoting to solutions without fully exploring the root cause of anxiety (e.g., perfectionism, financial stress), sometimes dismissing the student's core concern.\n\n**Recommendations:** Train the system to probe for underlying fears and mindset barriers *before* offering logistical fixes. Co-create \"minimum viable actions\" to make courage feel more manageable.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** The highest priority is to shift from a default \"problem-solver\" mode to a \"root-cause explorer,\" ensuring the core anxiety is addressed before actionable steps are introduced.",
