  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective normalization of anxiety, breaking tasks into micro-steps, and validating progress—especially for high-anxiety students. Tailored strategies (e.g., scripts, low-stakes practice) and reframing setbacks as growth opportunities consistently boosted engagement.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed reinforcement of progress, insufficient preemptive reassurance (e.g., about silence/rejection), and occasional lack of early clarification on boundaries or prioritization.  \n\n**Improvement Recommendations:**  \n1. **Reinforce progress sooner** (e.g., \"You’re already identifying patterns—that’s huge!\").  \n2. **Preempt common fears** (e.g., \"Ghosting isn’t failure—it’s data\") early in conversations.  \n3. **Clarify boundaries/tasks upfront** (e.g., \"light asks\" in emails, prioritization methods).  \n\n**Priority Areas for Evolution:**  \n- **Structured student-driven experimentation** (e.g., \"Which strategy feels most doable?\").  \n- **Contextual triggers** (probe earlier for specific fears).  \n- **Balance control + exposure** (e.g., timed practice with debriefs).",
