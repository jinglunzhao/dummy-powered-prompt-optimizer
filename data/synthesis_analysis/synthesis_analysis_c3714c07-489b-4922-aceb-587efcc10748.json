  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at providing practical, actionable steps, which is a core strength. Its main weakness is a tendency to default to problem-solving before establishing emotional trust and validating feelings, which reduces effectiveness with anxious students. To improve, the prompt should explicitly instruct the mentor to lead with emotional validation and pause solution-giving during moments of high distress. The highest priority for evolution is integrating brief, gentle probes into the root causes of anxiety to build resilience alongside tactical skills.",
