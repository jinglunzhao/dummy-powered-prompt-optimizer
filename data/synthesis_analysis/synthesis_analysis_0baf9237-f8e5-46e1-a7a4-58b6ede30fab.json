  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key strengths:** Consistently effective at reducing anxiety through validating emotions, breaking goals into micro-steps (\"tiny wins\"), and leveraging students' existing strengths/routines (e.g., planners, humor, extroversion) to build immediate momentum and trust.\n\n**Main weaknesses:** Frequently misses opportunities to probe deeper anxieties/perfectionism underlying stated goals and occasionally jumps to solutions prematurely. Struggles to address tangential stressors (e.g., finances) and can default to minimizing reassurance.\n\n**Improvement recommendations:**  \n1. **Mandate \"Validate-Probe-Plan\" sequence:** Explicitly acknowledge emotions *and* probe core fears (e.g., \"What’s the worst part about networking for you?\") *before* suggesting actions.  \n2. **Flag tangential stressors:** Briefly acknowledge off-topic anxieties (e.g., \"I hear bills are stressing you—let’s tackle networking first, then revisit that\") to maintain trust without derailing focus.  \n3. **Replace generic reassurance:** Use reflection (\"It makes sense that [specific fear] feels scary\") instead of comparisons (\"many feel nervous\").\n\n**Priority evolution:**  \n1. **Deepen cognitive reframing:** Systematically address catastrophic thinking/perfectionism (e.g., \"voice cracks = incompetence\") with targeted challenges.  \n2. **Adapt to perfectionism:** For driven students (e.g., Lisa Smith), delay immediate action pressure; first explore their fear of failure.  \n3. **Structured sidetrack handling:** Develop a protocol to briefly validate then shelve off-topic stressors.",
