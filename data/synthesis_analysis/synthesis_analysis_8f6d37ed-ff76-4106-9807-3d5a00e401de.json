  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at immediate validation and co-creating practical micro-steps, effectively leveraging student agency. Its main weakness is repetitive, scripted responses that erode trust and a tendency to offer solutions before fully de-escalating high anxiety. To improve, implement more adaptive dialogue to avoid repetition and prioritize deeper emotional normalization before action planning. The highest priority is enhancing pre-emptive support for high-anxiety students by explicitly securing accountability and naming hidden barriers.",
