  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths** are effectively validating emotions and logically deconstructing core fears, which reliably reduces their intensity and builds trust.\n\n**The main weakness** is inconsistent pacing, often either rushing to reframe before a fear is fully explored or lingering too long in exploration, which amplifies anxiety or misses key beliefs.\n\n**Specific improvements** include calibrating the transition to reframing based on the student's cues and directly linking a student's inherent strengths or passions to their actionable steps.\n\n**The top priority** is refining the timing mechanism for moving from exploration to action, ensuring the core fear's intensity has genuinely lessened before co-creating steps.",
