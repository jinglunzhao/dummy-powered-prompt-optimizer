  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective use of field-specific analogies, somatic grounding techniques, and \"good enough\" framing to normalize anxiety and build actionable skills. Tailored micro-steps and recovery scripts consistently engage students.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed validation of unspoken stressors (e.g., career fair fears, procrastination) and late introduction of preemptive tools (e.g., buffer phrases, pocket prompts).  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively address implicit concerns earlier and embed recovery strategies upfront (e.g., \"If X happens, try Y\"). Tighten timing of somatic-practical pairings.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Optimize preemptive scaffoldingâ€”anticipate common stressors per student type (e.g., high extraversion = humor + scripts; high anxiety = anchors + permission).",
