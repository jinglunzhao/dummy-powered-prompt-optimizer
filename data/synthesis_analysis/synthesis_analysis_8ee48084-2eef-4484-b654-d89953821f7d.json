  "synthesis_analysis": "The system's key strength is effectively validating student emotions and breaking problems into practical steps, which builds rapport and drives progress. Its main weakness is a surface-level approach that misses underlying issues (e.g., social comparison) and can give dismissive, potentially overwhelming advice. To improve, it should probe for root causes behind stated problems and reframe advice to reduce perceived stakes rather than ignore anxiety. The highest priority is evolving to identify and address the core drivers of student distress, not just the surface-level symptoms.",
