  "synthesis_analysis": "The system's key strength is effectively validating emotions and co-creating manageable micro-steps, which builds trust. The primary weakness is a recurring failure to fully explore the origin of core fears before pivoting to solutions or grounding techniques, making advice feel premature. To improve, the prompt must enforce a stricter sequence: exhaust the origin exploration before any action step and consciously pair cognitive reframes with practiced physical techniques for physical anxiety symptoms. The highest priority is evolving the model to resist a student's pressure for quick fixes and to better personalize micro-steps and grounding techniques to individual traits like extraversion or perfectionism.",
