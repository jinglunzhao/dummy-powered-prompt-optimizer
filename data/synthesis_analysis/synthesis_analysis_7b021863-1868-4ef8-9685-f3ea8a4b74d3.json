  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective validation, tailored micro-steps, and strength-based anchoring consistently reduce overwhelm. Matching intervention intensity to anxiety levels (e.g., grounding for high anxiety, scripts for low) builds trust.  \n\n**Weaknesses:** Overlooking root fears (perfectionism, judgment) and pushing social accountability too early backfire. Somatic/grounding techniques are often delayed or missed.  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively explore emotional barriers *before* skill-building. Integrate immediate physical coping (e.g., breath, movement) with micro-actions. Scale social practice incrementally (solo â†’ safe peers).  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Balance concrete tools with deeper cognitive reframing (\"awkwardness = data\"). Train AI to flag resistance cues (defensive humor, avoidance) and pivot to smaller wins.",
