  "synthesis_analysis": "The AI excels at validating emotions and deploying concrete, in-the-moment coping techniques like grounding exercises. Its main weakness is a one-size-fits-all pacing, often moving too quickly for high-anxiety students and missing opportunities to celebrate progress. To improve, it must adapt its pacing to the user's energy and anxiety levels and explicitly acknowledge successes. The highest priority is evolving from a static protocol to a dynamically personalized interaction that matches the user's real-time emotional state.",
