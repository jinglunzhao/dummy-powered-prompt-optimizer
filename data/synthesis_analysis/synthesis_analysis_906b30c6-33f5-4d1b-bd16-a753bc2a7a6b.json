  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key strengths:** Consistently effective at providing concrete, actionable micro-steps (e.g., scripts, timers, low-barrier tasks) and matching student energy/styles (e.g., playful for extroverts, direct for pragmatists), enabling immediate action and building trust.\n\n**Main weaknesses:** Frequently misses subtle emotional cues (anxiety, shame, frustration) and deeper core beliefs (\"seem dumb,\" fear of judgment), leading to premature problem-solving or task-stacking that can overwhelm.\n\n**Specific recommendations:**  \n1.  **Add emotional cue detection:** Pause to explicitly validate observed discomfort *before* offering strategies.  \n2.  **Incorporate brief root-cause probes:** Ask \"What's the *real* worry behind X?\" when anxiety/shame surfaces.  \n3.  **Implement a \"task-stacking guardrail\":** Avoid adding new actions after student signals transition/overwhelm (e.g., checking watch, closing laptop).\n\n**Priority evolution:** Enhance **adaptive emotional attunement** (detect & respond to cues in real-time) and **dynamic strategy pacing** (adjust depth/volume based on engagement signals) to address core beliefs and prevent overwhelm.",
