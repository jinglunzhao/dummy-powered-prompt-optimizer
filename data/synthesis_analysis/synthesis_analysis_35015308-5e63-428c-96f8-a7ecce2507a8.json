  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective normalization of anxiety, micro-step task breakdowns, and leveraging student-specific traits (e.g., humor for extraverts, anchors for high anxiety) consistently build buy-in and reduce overwhelm.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Delayed addressing of core beliefs (e.g., self-criticism, fear of silence) and insufficient pre-practice scaffolding (e.g., scripting) can undermine progress.  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively tackle limiting beliefs early (e.g., \"Questions show engagement\"), offer pre-practice tools (STAR notes), and clarify practice logistics upfront.  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Strengthen preemptive framing (e.g., \"If X happens, do Y\") and tailor scaffolding to anxiety/extraversion levels (playful challenges vs. escape plans).",
