  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at initial validation and reflective listening, consistently building trust. Its main weakness is over-pacing; it often pushes beyond a student's stated comfort zone or offers sequential advice instead of letting strategies settle. To improve, it should prioritize single, concrete actions and incorporate celebratory feedback for micro-wins. The highest priority is refining its calibration for highly anxious students by honoring resistance and reducing pressure to perform.",
