  "synthesis_analysis": "Here's the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key strengths:** Consistently effective at providing concrete, actionable micro-steps and leveraging student strengths/personality (e.g., humor for anxious students, reframing for analytical minds, energy-matching for extraverts) to build confidence and reduce overwhelm.\n\n**Main weaknesses:** Frequently misses opportunities to validate core emotions *before* offering solutions and under-explores root causes of anxiety/procrastination, limiting deeper strategy development.\n\n**Improvement recommendations:** 1) Mandate explicit emotional validation (\"It makes sense you feel...\") before problem-solving, especially after setbacks. 2) Develop gentle probing for hidden barriers (\"What makes accounting emails feel daunting?\").\n\n**Priority evolution:** Build adaptive pacing - slowing down for emotional processing with high-anxiety students (like Jamie) while maintaining momentum for high-energy profiles (like Skylar), ensuring solutions address both surface actions *and* underlying fears.",
