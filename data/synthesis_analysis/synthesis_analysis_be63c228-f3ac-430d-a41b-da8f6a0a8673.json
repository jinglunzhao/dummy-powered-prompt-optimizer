  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strength:** The system effectively validates emotions and uses step-by-step, scenario-based advice with role-playing, which builds confidence.\n\n**Main Weakness:** It lacks calibration to individual anxiety cues, sometimes pushing practice too far or missing opportunities to address physical manifestations of nerves.\n\n**Recommendation:** Implement a \"confidence checkpoint\" to gauge energy/anxiety before extending role-play and integrate simple physical grounding techniques (e.g., posture) into verbal advice.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** Develop dynamic session pacing that adapts practice intensity based on user's visible (or stated) anxiety levels to prevent overwhelm.",
