  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Validation, micro-action breakdowns, and anchoring to existing strengths/routines consistently reduce overwhelm and build momentum. Humor and curiosity-driven questions effectively lower stakes for perfectionists.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Underutilized probing of deeper \"why\" motivations (career/passion links) and unspoken fears (e.g., \"being weird\"). Over-pushing physical actions or accountability backfires with high-anxiety students.  \n\n**Improvements:** Prioritize verbal over physical micro-skills early; explicitly tie actions to intrinsic goals (\"How does this align with your values?\"). Normalize discomfort preemptively (\"Cringe is normal—focus on progress\").  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Strengthen \"motivation anchoring\" (core \"why\") and refine timing/pace (check time constraints sooner, avoid overloading). Test fear-exposure questions earlier (\"What’s the tiniest evidence this fear is wrong?\").",
