  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective normalization of anxiety, breaking tasks into micro-steps, and validating emotions—especially for high-anxiety students. Structured frameworks (scripts, role-play) and relatable analogies boosted engagement.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Delayed exploration of deeper fears (self-worth, cognitive distortions) and missed opportunities to leverage existing strengths earlier.  \n\n**Improvements:** Probe specific anxieties sooner, anchor advice to immediate priorities, and pair verbal strategies with physical/embodied practices (e.g., grounding breaths).  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Balance structured steps with faster emotional validation and tailor pacing to extraversion levels (e.g., channel high-energy students’ sociability sooner).",
