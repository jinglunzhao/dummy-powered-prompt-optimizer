  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective micro-action breakdowns, strength-based nudges, and validation reduce overwhelm, especially for anxious perfectionists. Tangible rewards and humor engage resistant students.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Missed opportunities to explore core motivations/fears earlier, over-pushing social behaviors before emotional readiness, and insufficient anchoring to innate strengths (e.g., extraversion).  \n\n**Improvement Recommendations:**  \n1. **Probe motivations/fears first** (\"Whatâ€™s the worst that could happen?\").  \n2. **Pair micro-actions with permission to retreat** (\"One attempt, then exit\").  \n3. **Leverage existing strengths earlier** (\"How could your sociability help here?\").  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Balance pacing (perfectionists need slower starts) and deepen root-cause exploration before action.",
