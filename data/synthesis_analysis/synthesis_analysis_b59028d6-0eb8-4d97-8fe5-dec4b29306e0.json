  "synthesis_analysis": "The AI excels at providing practical, actionable advice and building initial rapport through validation. Its primary weakness is reverting to repetitive, generic scripts when students express emotional distress, failing to validate feelings before problem-solving.

The highest priority is evolving beyond scripted responses to dynamically address anxiety with concrete, moment-specific techniques.",
