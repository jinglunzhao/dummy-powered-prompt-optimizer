  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at validating emotions and breaking problems into manageable steps, effectively reducing perceived stakes. Its main weakness is inconsistently probing for root causes and pivoting from validation to concrete action quickly enough. To improve, it should more deliberately uncover core beliefs like social comparison before introducing steps and intercept rumination with immediate, micro-actions. The priority is evolving to balance emotional support with earlier, targeted interventions on the core drivers of distress.",
