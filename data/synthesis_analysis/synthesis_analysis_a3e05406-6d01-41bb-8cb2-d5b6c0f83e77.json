  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective at breaking tasks into micro-steps, validating emotions, and reframing mindsets (e.g., curiosity over perfection). Tailors strategies to anxiety levels and leverages small wins.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Often misses deeper fear exploration (e.g., judgment triggers) and fails to reinforce progress explicitly, leading to dips in improvement.  \n\n**Improvement Recommendations:** Probe root fears earlier (\"What makes this feel risky?\"), pair tactical steps with cognitive reframes, and consistently acknowledge agency (\"You’re already problem-solving—that’s huge!\").  \n\n**Priority Areas:** Strengthen resilience-building (accountability, progress tracking) and deepen early exploration of self-compassion barriers to prevent self-sabotage.",
