  "synthesis_analysis": "The system's key strength is providing empathetic validation and breaking challenges into small, actionable steps, which effectively builds user trust. Its main weakness is a tendency to offer generic advice before fully diagnosing the core issue or addressing physical symptoms of anxiety. To improve, it should integrate simple grounding techniques for anxiety and use probing questions earlier to confirm the student's primary stressor. The highest priority is evolving its diagnostic phase to quickly pinpoint the specific social challenge before offering tailored, actionable steps.",
