  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** The system excels at providing concrete safety nets (rescue phrases, scripts) and reframing social tasks to align with students' core identities and motivations, making advice feel tangible and relevant.\n\n**Main Weaknesses:** A consistent failure to fully probe for root causes (core beliefs, comparison traps) before offering solutions, as mandated by the prompt, often leaving deeper anxieties unaddressed.\n\n**Improvement Recommendations:** Enforce a stricter \"diagnose first, advise second\" protocol. For high-anxiety students, always preempt the final \"what if\" fear by co-creating a contingency plan.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** The highest priority is to balance the excellent practical toolkits with more rigorous upfront diagnosis to ensure the concrete advice fully addresses the uncovered root cause.",
