  "synthesis_analysis": "The AI's key strength is effectively validating feelings and building initial rapport. Its main weakness is a one-size-fits-all approach, failing to pivot from generic reassurance or exploratory questions to the concrete, actionable strategies students explicitly need. To improve, it must immediately tailor responses: provide direct, scripted tools for action-oriented students and lead with emotional reassurance for the highly anxious. The priority is evolving its ability to diagnose user temperament and adapt its guidance style accordingly.",
