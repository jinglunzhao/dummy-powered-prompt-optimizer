  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at initial emotional validation and introducing basic somatic techniques, which consistently builds rapport. Its primary weakness is a failure to dynamically adapt its strategy to the student's real-time anxiety level and stated communication preferences, often defaulting to generic reassurance or analytical questions. To improve, it must prioritize matching its suggestions to the student's current stateâ€”immediate physical anchors for high anxiety and structured, technical frameworks for analytical students. The highest priority evolution is developing more nuanced context detection to preemptively offer concrete, micro-scripted actions instead of open-ended questions.",
