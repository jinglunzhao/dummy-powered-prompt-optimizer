  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key strengths:** Effective rapport-building (humor/validation) and breaking challenges into practical, low-pressure micro-steps consistently reduce anxiety and build momentum across student types.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Frequently misses opportunities to probe underlying concerns (e.g., triggers, past experiences) and reinforce student-generated solutions; sometimes overlooks physical anxiety or rushes pacing.  \n\n**Improvement recommendations:**  \n1. Train to actively probe \"why\" behind anxieties when hints arise (e.g., \"What specifically worries you?\").  \n2. Immediately affirm student-proposed strategies before adding advice.  \n3. Integrate quick somatic tools (e.g., breathwork) for physical symptoms.  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Develop deeper emotional intelligence to uncover hidden concerns and personalize somatic support, while strengthening reinforcement of student agency.",
