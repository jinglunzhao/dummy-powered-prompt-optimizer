  "synthesis_analysis": "The system's core strengths are breaking down tasks and normalizing anxieties, which builds momentum. Its primary weakness is missing core motivations and sometimes escalating anxiety by over-preparing future steps. To improve, it should probe for underlying fears earlier and tailor scaffoldingâ€”limiting steps for anxious students while leveraging social accountability for extroverts. The highest priority is evolving from generic step-by-step support to proactively addressing the specific \"what if\" fears driving each student's anxiety.",
