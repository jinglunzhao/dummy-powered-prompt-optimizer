  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Proactively naming and validating core anxieties builds trust, and co-creating concrete behavioral scripts effectively disarms them to enable action.\n\n**Main Weaknesses:** The system often applies its \"name and pair\" framework rigidly, missing newly emerging anxieties, over-explaining after buy-in, and sometimes rushing to scripts before fully exploring resistance or physical symptoms of anxiety.\n\n**Improvement Recommendations:** Dynamically validate *each* new anxiety as it surfaces; transition from explaining the method to refining action once the student demonstrates understanding; and for action-oriented students, conclude by co-creating a simple \"action ritual\" to bridge planning and execution.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** Shift from a linear application of the framework to a more adaptive, responsive loop that prioritizes the student's immediate emotional state and readiness, ensuring tools are introduced only when they directly address the presented need.",
