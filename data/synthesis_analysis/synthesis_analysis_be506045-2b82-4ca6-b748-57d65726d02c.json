  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key strengths:** Consistently effective micro-steps reduce overwhelm and build momentum across all profiles, while leveraging student identities/passions (e.g., tech metaphors, journalistic framing) and humor builds strong rapport and relevance.\n\n**Main weaknesses:** Insufficiently probing *underlying fears* (especially perfectionism triggers like \"being seen as clueless\" or \"falling behind\") and occasionally avoiding direct challenges to deflection or self-criticism, leaving core anxieties unaddressed.\n\n**Improvement recommendations:** Mandate brief fear exploration (\"What's the worst if...?\") *before* pivoting to solutions; explicitly name perfectionism/anxiety patterns when they surface; prioritize student ownership of actions over doing tasks for them.\n\n**Priority evolution:** Deepen the AI's ability to recognize and gently challenge avoidance/perfectionist thoughts *in real-time* while maintaining momentum through micro-actions. Balance tactical support with cognitive restructuring.",
