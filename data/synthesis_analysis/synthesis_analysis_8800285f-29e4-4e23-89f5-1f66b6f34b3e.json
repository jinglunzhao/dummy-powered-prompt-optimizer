  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective breakdown of challenges into small, manageable steps, validation of emotions, and use of domain-specific analogies (e.g., \"debugging\" for analytical students).  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed or missed addressing of core fears (e.g., judgment anxiety, self-doubt) and occasional overemphasis on prescribed behaviors over authenticity.  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively reframe fears early (e.g., \"Discomfort means growth\"), leverage students' natural strengths (e.g., extraversion), and pair micro-actions with mindset shifts (\"progress over perfection\").  \n\n**Priority Areas:** Deeper emotional validation, earlier exploration of root anxieties, and tighter alignment of strategies with individual traits (e.g., humor for resistant students).",
