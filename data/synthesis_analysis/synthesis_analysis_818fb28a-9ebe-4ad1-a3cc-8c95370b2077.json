  "synthesis_analysis": "The mentor's key strength is providing validation and practical, co-created plans that students find supportive. Its main weakness is a tendency to offer general reassurance and surface-level advice without first diagnosing the core issue or providing techniques to break negative thought cycles. To improve, it should pivot from reassurance to specific cognitive exercises (e.g., reframing, scripting) and prioritize precise problem identification before solutioneering. The top priority for evolution is to address the root cognitive patterns, not just the situational anxiety.",
