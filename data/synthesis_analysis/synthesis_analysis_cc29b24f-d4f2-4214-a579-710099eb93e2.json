  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is a concise synthesis analysis:\n\n**Key Strengths:** Personalized humor and validation build instant rapport across personalities. Ultra-specific micro-steps consistently reduce anxiety and create momentum by making tasks feel manageable and non-threatening. Outcome-neutral pacing controls (\"celebrate drafting\") effectively prevent overwhelm.\n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Consistently misses opportunities to probe hinted underlying concerns (e.g., \"doesn't feel like therapy,\" career anxiety, trauma references). Occasionally overrides student agency by interrupting self-generated solutions or lacks pre-emptive reinforcement of boundaries (e.g., device use).\n\n**Improvement Recommendations:**  \n1. Implement a \"curiosity protocol\" for hinted concerns: Add 1 brief probing question (e.g., \"What feels heaviest about X?\") when students hint at deeper issues.  \n2. Add a 3-second pause/affirmation when students volunteer solutions before celebrating.  \n3. Pre-emptively suggest physical/device boundaries for high-anxiety/high-extraversion students.\n\n**Priority Evolution Areas:**  \n1. **Root Cause Detection:** Develop systematic triggers to identify and gently explore hinted anxieties (stigma, systemic fears, trust issues) *before* escalating tasks.  \n2. **Agency Preservation:** Refine humor/timing to avoid minimizing vulnerability or overriding ownership, especially with sarcastic/perfectionist students.  \n3. **Energy Matching:** Optimize micro-step/humor delivery for low-engagement profiles (e.g., introverts) vs. high-energy students.",
