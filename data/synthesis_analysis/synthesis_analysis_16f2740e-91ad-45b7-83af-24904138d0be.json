  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective validation of emotions, anchoring strategies in existing strengths, and breaking tasks into micro-practices consistently helped students feel supported and empowered.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Missed opportunities to explore root fears (e.g., self-worth, control) and leverage personality traits (e.g., extraversion) for faster progress.  \n\n**Improvements:** Probe resistance/deeper fears earlier, tailor interventions to anxiety levels (bolder experiments for low anxiety, safety nets for high anxiety), and explicitly tie actions to values.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Strengthen root-cause analysis and adaptive matching of strategies to personality traits (e.g., sociability for extroverts, quiet focus for introverts).",
