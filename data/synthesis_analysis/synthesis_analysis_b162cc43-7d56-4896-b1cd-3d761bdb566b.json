  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key strengths:** Effectively adapts tactics to personality types (e.g., gamification for high extraversion, refining coping mechanisms for anxiety, micro-steps for low extraversion) and leverages existing student habits/identities to build trust and action.\n\n**Main weaknesses:** Consistent premature solution-jumping; probing intrinsic motivations (\"why\") often occurs *after* or is missed entirely before suggesting actions, risking generic advice and weaker long-term engagement.\n\n**Specific recommendations:** Mandate at least one open-ended \"why\" probe (e.g., \"What draws you to this?\", \"Why does this matter to you?\") *before* any action suggestion to deepen intrinsic motivation and personalization.\n\n**Priority evolution:** Strengthen foundational motivational probing discipline *before* action planning, ensuring the \"why\" is understood to make solutions more resonant and sustainable.",
