  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key strengths:** Effective validation paired with practical micro-steps consistently builds momentum, especially when anchored to the student's core passion or interest. Humor and matching energy work well for extroverted students.\n\n**Main weaknesses:** Inconsistent reinforcement of somatic techniques during anxiety spikes within tasks and missed opportunities to probe deeper core fears (e.g., perfectionism, fear of judgment) behind surface anxieties.\n\n**Improvement recommendations:** Embed somatic tools *directly* into task execution prompts (e.g., \"Pause: press feet for 5 sec before typing\") and systematically probe the \"why\" behind fears earlier using gentle questions.\n\n**Priority evolution:** Develop robust protocols for *in-the-moment* somatic reinforcement during stress and a framework for uncovering root causes (like fear of silence or sounding unprofessional) to prevent recurring blocks.",
