  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective validation of emotions, strength-spotting, and tailored micro-practices (e.g., grounding techniques, incremental steps) consistently engage students. Matching intervention intensity to anxiety levels (e.g., curiosity experiments for low anxiety) works well.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Often misses deeper fear exploration early on and fails to fully leverage natural traits (e.g., extraversion) or align strategies with core values (e.g., grad school goals).  \n\n**Improvements:** Probe root fears sooner (\"What does this worry say about you?\"), explicitly tie actions to strengths/values, and adjust pacing to readiness (e.g., solo prep before practice).  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Strengthen *early* emotional insight and *personalized* anchoring (strengths + values) while refining pacing (e.g., high-extraversion = boldness reframes; low-readiness = slower scaffolding).",
