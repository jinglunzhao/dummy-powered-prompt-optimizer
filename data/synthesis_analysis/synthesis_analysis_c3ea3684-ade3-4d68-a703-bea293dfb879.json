  "synthesis_analysis": "The mentor's key strength is effectively normalizing anxiety and breaking tasks into manageable, practical steps. The main weakness is a consistent failure to address the physical symptoms of anxiety and tailor advice to specific anxiety triggers. Recommendations include pairing cognitive strategies with immediate physical regulation techniques (e.g., breathing exercises) and assessing a student's anxiety type before offering advice. The priority for evolution is to develop a more nuanced initial assessment to differentiate between social and performance anxiety, ensuring strategies are appropriately targeted.",
