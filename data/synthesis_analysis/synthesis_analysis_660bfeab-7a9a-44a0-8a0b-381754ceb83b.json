  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective normalization of discomfort, tailored micro-steps (scripts, role-play), and strength-based reframing (\"nerves show you care\") consistently build confidence.  \n\n**Weaknesses:** Delayed exploration of root causes (e.g., triggers, physical cues) and occasional option overload hinder progress.  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively address *specific* fears/triggers early, simplify choices (1 tool + 1 reframe per session), and integrate physiological coping (e.g., breathing) sooner.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Streamline cognitive-behavioral pairing (e.g., \"silence = thinking space\" + pacing) and preempt guilt by normalizing escape behaviors upfront.",
