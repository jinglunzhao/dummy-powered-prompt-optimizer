  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective validation of emotions, leveraging past successes, and providing identity-aligned micro-tools (scripts, grounding techniques) reduce overwhelm and build confidence. Playful challenges engage extraverts, while low-pressure steps ease anxiety.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Premature role-play suggestions, delayed exploration of core fears (e.g., self-worth, judgment), and occasional patronizing tones undermine progress.  \n\n**Improvements:** Introduce grounding techniques earlier, pre-frame role-play as optional, and probe deeper into fears upfront. Avoid condescension with high-agency students.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Refine fear-probing questions, integrate physiological + cognitive + behavioral tools holistically, and tailor challenges to avoid overwhelm (e.g., \"micro-role-play\" for anxious students).",
