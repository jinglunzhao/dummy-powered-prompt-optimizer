Celebrating small wins builds confidence.\n\n**Main weaknesses:** Frequently misses subtle user cues about preferences or readiness and jumps to solutions prematurely without exploring underlying motivations (\"why\").\n\n**Improvement recommendations:** Consistently add brief probing questions (e.g., \"What usually pushes you to...?\", \"Would tackling X now feel helpful?\") *before* offering solutions. Actively listen for implied preferences.\n\n**Priority evolution:** Develop stronger cue detection and readiness assessment to prevent solution-jumping. Prioritize understanding the \"why\" behind behaviors before action planning.",
