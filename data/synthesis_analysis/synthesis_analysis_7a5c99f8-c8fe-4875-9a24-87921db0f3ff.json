  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strength:** The mentor consistently excels at co-creating concrete, practical scripts and tools, which directly builds student confidence and enables actionable steps.\n\n**Primary Weakness:** There is a recurring failure to explicitly name and validate the student's core underlying anxiety (e.g., fear of inadequacy, being judged), leaving the root cause unaddressed and limiting long-term impact.\n\n**Specific Improvement:** Proactively identify and label the specific root fear (e.g., \"That sounds like a fear of being seen as unimpressive\") *before* moving to problem-solving, and more carefully match practice methods to individual student styles.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** Shift from a primary focus on behavioral scripts to a dual approach that integrates immediate practical tools with a direct, validating challenge to the underlying negative self-judgment.",
