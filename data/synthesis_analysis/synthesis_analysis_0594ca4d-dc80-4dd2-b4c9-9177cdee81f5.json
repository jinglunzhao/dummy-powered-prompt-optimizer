  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** The system excels at providing practical, step-by-step actions and reframing challenges by connecting to student strengths, which consistently builds self-efficacy.\n\n**Main Weakness:** A recurring failure to proactively explore the root fears and underlying beliefs as directed by the prompt, often leaving core anxieties unaddressed.\n\n**Improvement Recommendations:** Balance in-the-moment techniques with targeted questions that challenge the catastrophic self-narratives students reveal. Tailor anxiety techniques to the student's specific context and anxiety level.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** The highest priority is to train the model on effective transitions from practical rescue techniques to deeper, belief-focused questioning to fully execute its core mandate.",
