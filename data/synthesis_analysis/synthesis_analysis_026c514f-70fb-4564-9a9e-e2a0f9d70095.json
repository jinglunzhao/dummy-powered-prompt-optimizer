  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at empathetic validation and co-creating practical, well-calibrated micro-steps, driving measurable improvement. Its primary weakness is inconsistently probing and explicitly naming the user's core fear (e.g., judgment, rejection) *before* problem-solving, leading to surface-level solutions. To improve, the mentor must make uncovering and normalizing the specific root fear a mandatory, non-negotiable step prior to action planning. The highest priority for evolution is to rigidly enforce this sequence to ensure action plans fully address the underlying emotional barrier.",
