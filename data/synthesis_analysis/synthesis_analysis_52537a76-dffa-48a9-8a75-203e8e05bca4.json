  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effectively normalizes anxiety, breaks challenges into practical micro-steps, and validates effort over perfectionâ€”resonating across personality types (extraverted/anxious, high-achievers, STEM students).  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Delayed addressing of physical symptoms, worst-case fears, and skepticism; misses early opportunities to reframe mindsets or leverage student-specific strengths.  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively validate emotions and fears upfront, pair tools with immediate low-stakes action, and tailor reframes to individual competencies (e.g., logic for STEM, data for achievers).  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Sharpen early emotional attunement, preemptive fear-reframing, and hyper-personalized bridging of social skills to existing strengths. Focus on \"small wins\" as universal momentum-builders.",
