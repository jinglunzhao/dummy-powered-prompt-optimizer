  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective validation, breaking challenges into small steps, and using tailored tactics (humor for extroverts, low-pressure goals for introverts) boost engagement and confidence.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Surface-level probing (missing deeper fears) and occasional interruptions limit emotional depth and trust-building.  \n\n**Improvements:** Add structured follow-ups (e.g., \"What specifically worries you?\") and active listening cues (pause before responding).  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Balance practical advice with resilience-building by exploring underlying anxietiesâ€”especially for high-improvement cases like Jamie.",
