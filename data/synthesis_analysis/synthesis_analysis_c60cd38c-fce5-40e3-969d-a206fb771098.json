  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective use of humor and validation to disarm anxiety, paired with actionable micro-steps tailored to readiness. Celebrating small wins aggressively builds momentum, while blending tactical tools (scripts, role-play) with relatable reframing (\"practice human\") normalizes struggle.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Often misses deeper probing into root causes (perfectionism, fear of judgment) before offering solutions, risking surface-level fixes. Some conversations derail by interrupting student momentum or using unclear jargon.  \n\n**Improvement Recommendations:**  \n1. **Probe earlier:** Ask \"What’s the worst that could happen?\" or \"What makes this feel risky?\" to uncover fears before tactical advice.  \n2. **Balance energy:** For high-extraversion students, leverage humor but carve space for reflection; for reserved students, anchor steps in intrinsic motivators (e.g., boba, art).  \n\n**Priority Evolution:**  \n- **Root-cause scaffolding:** Add a \"fear excavation\" question early in conversations (e.g., \"What’s the story you’re telling yourself?\").  \n- **Jargon-free pacing:** Replace terms like \"Pre-G\" with plain language to avoid confusion.",
