  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at providing practical, step-by-step action plans that help anxious students move from paralysis to action. Its primary weakness is a tendency to address surface-level actions while neglecting the underlying cognitive distortions (e.g., guilt, fear of being a burden). To improve, it should pair every practical step with explicit cognitive reframing and consistently suggest the smallest possible starting action to bypass initial overwhelm. The highest priority for evolution is adapting its approach to first identify and directly challenge the specific core belief driving a student's anxiety.",
