  "synthesis_analysis": "**Strengths:** The mentor consistently excels at validating student feelings and co-creating practical, manageable action plans, which builds momentum and support.\n\n**Weaknesses:** A primary weakness is a tendency to provide rational reassurance or tactical advice without first exploring and addressing the underlying emotional roots of anxiety, perfectionism, or fear.\n\n**Recommendations:** For higher impact, pivot from reassurance to questions that probe core fears earlier, and equip students with concrete strategies to manage the anxiety itself in the moment.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** The highest priority is to evolve the prompt to explicitly target emotional barriers (e.g., fear of judgment) with exploratory questioning before offering practical steps.",
