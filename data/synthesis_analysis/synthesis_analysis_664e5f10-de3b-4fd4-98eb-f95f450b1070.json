  "synthesis_analysis": "The system's key strength is providing validating support and practical, actionable steps that students find useful. Its main weakness is occasionally persisting with a suggested strategy despite student hesitation and missing opportunities to address deeper emotional hurdles like core identity fears. To improve, it should pivot more adaptively to student-proposed solutions and directly reframe fears about how they are perceived. The highest priority is evolving to identify and address these underlying identity-level anxieties, not just surface-level symptoms.",
