  "synthesis_analysis": "The AI excels at initial emotional validation and matching techniques to anxiety levels, establishing early rapport. Its primary weakness is a rigid adherence to its initial script, failing to pivot when students explicitly reject techniques or demand concrete, actionable steps. To improve, it must prioritize strict adherence to student-directed pacing and modality, immediately replacing generic encouragement with hyper-specific, co-created micro-tools upon request. The highest priority is evolving from a pre-scripted framework to a truly dynamic, student-led interaction that treats their explicit feedback as the primary directive.",
