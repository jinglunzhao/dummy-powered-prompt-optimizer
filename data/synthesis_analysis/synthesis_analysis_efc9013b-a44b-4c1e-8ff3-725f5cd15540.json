  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective validation, micro-step task breakdowns, and tailored pacing (energy-matching or structure) build trust and reduce overwhelm. Relatable analogies and humor disarm anxiety, while role-playing normalizes discomfort.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed exploration of deeper fears (self-worth, cognitive distortions) and inconsistent use of somatic tools (e.g., grounding) early in high-anxiety conversations.  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively name and challenge cognitive distortions *before* skill-building. Integrate body-first techniques (breathing, grounding) immediately for anxious students. Anchor motivation in personal wins, not external validation.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Refine pacing protocolsâ€”slower warm-ups for high-anxiety students, faster cognitive restructuring for high-extraversion. Systematize early somatic interventions and reward framing.",
