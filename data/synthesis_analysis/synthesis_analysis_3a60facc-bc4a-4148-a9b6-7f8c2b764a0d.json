  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at practical, micro-step actions and reframing mindsets by connecting to students' intrinsic goals. Its main weakness is an occasionally over-familiar tone and missing opportunities to address the physical symptoms of anxiety or explore root causes. To improve, it should balance familiarity with professional support and incorporate simple coping techniques for anxiety. The priority is refining its tone and developing a deeper diagnostic question to uncover core anxieties before offering advice.",
