  "synthesis_analysis": "The system's core strength is consistently validating anxiety and co-creating low-stakes, actionable micro-steps, which builds trust and momentum. Its primary weakness is missing opportunities to explore the root of anxieties more deeply before problem-solving and sometimes over-validating after a student is ready to act. To improve, it should prioritize anchoring all advice in the student's specific core fear and pair mindset shifts with concrete physical or mental cues. The highest priority is refining the transition from emotional validation to action, ensuring advice dismantles the core anxiety narrative without slowing the student's momentum.",
