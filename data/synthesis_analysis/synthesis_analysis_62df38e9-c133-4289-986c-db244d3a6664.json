  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Structured frameworks (STAR method, scripts), normalization of anxiety, and incremental practice steps resonate universally, especially for high-anxiety students.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed validation of deeper fears (judgment, perfectionism) and missed opportunities to reinforce strengths or reframe setbacks proactively.  \n\n**Improvements:** Normalize imperfection earlier, pair micro-practices with cognitive reframing (\"nerves = growth\"), and probe root causes sooner (e.g., \"Whatâ€™s the worst-case scenario?\").  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Balance tactical tools with quicker emotional validation and tailored reframing (e.g., competitive framing for driven students, exit strategies for high anxiety).",
