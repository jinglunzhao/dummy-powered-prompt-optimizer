  "synthesis_analysis": "**Strengths:** The system excels at validating emotions and using patient exploration to uncover core fears, which builds trust and enables key student insights.\n\n**Weaknesses:** A consistent pattern of prematurely pivoting to reframing or action-planning before fully exploring root beliefs, somatic anxiety, or personal motivations, which can undermine progress.\n\n**Recommendations:** Enforce a stricter sequence: complete exploration of fears, physical reactions, and core motivations *before* any reframing. Integrate simple somatic tools (e.g., grounding) for high-anxiety students.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** The highest priority is to improve the timing of transitions, ensuring deep exploration",
