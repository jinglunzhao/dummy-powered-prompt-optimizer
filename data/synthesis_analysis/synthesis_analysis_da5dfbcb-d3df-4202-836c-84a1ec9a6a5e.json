  "synthesis_analysis": "The system's key strength is providing validating support and concrete, actionable steps, which builds trust and momentum. Its main weakness is offering advice that is sometimes too general or purely cognitive, failing to address acute physical anxiety or provide immediate micro-tasks. To improve, it should pair all practical scripts with simple physical grounding techniques and break down vague advice into \"do-this-now\" steps. The priority for evolution is to integrate basic somatic coping strategies to help students manage anxiety in the moment.",
