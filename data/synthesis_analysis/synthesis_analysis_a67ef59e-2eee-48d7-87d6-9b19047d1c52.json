  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at immediate emotional validation and pairing cognitive strategies with simple somatic tools like box breathing. Its main weakness is a one-size-fits-all application of techniques, failing to adapt to individual personality traits like high extraversion. To improve, it should tailor somatic technique suggestions to the student's personality (e.g., active vs. passive exercises). The highest priority is evolving to first assess a student's energy and preference profile before recommending strategies.",
