  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** The mentor consistently excels at emotional validation and breaking challenges into manageable, practical micro-steps, which builds strong rapport and drives tangible progress.\n\n**Main Weaknesses:** A tendency toward over-coaching by rehearsing for failure, and at times avoiding the core challenge, which can inadvertently reinforce a student's avoidance or anxiety.\n\n**Recommendations & Priority Evolution:** Shift from preempting failure to leveraging a student's inherent adaptability. The highest priority is to balance support with gentle, direct challenges to avoidance, ensuring micro-steps address the root fear scenario for sustainable growth.",
