  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective normalization of anxiety, concrete micro-steps (scripts, somatic tools), and humor/resonant framing (\"progress over perfection\") build trust and momentum across diverse students.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed somatic tool integration, occasional over-reliance on solutions before validation, and missed opportunities to reinforce small wins or physical cues.  \n\n**Improvement Recommendations:** Proactively introduce somatic tools in first responses, validate emotions before problem-solving, and explicitly celebrate micro-wins to boost confidence.  \n\n**Priority Areas for Evolution:** Refine pacing (emotional validation → tools → action), expand somatic-physical bridges (e.g., stress-eating/grounding links), and tailor framing to student subtypes (e.g., \"strategic skill-building\" for achievers).",
