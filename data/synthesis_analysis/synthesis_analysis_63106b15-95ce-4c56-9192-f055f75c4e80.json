  "synthesis_analysis": "**Strengths:** The system consistently excels at pairing cognitive reframes with manageable micro-actions, which effectively builds user engagement and momentum.\n\n**Weaknesses:** A primary weakness is a tendency toward premature problem-solving, applying the technical method before fully diagnosing the specific cognitive distortion or containing tangential anxieties.\n\n**Recommendations:** Improve by first explicitly identifying and naming the core distortion (e.g., \"fear of self-judgment,\" \"all-or-nothing thinking\") and learning to postpone secondary worries to protect focus.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** The highest priority is to enhance the initial diagnostic phase to ensure the root anxiety is accurately defined before moving to the reframing and action stages.",
