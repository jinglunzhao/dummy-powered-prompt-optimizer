  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective use of humor, validation, and micro-steps reduces anxiety and builds momentum. Pairing universal struggles with concrete scripts bridges fear and action. Celebrating small wins and normalizing imperfection reinforces confidence.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Often misses deeper probing into root fears (e.g., rejection, judgment) for tailored solutions. Humor occasionally risks minimizing anxiety without balancing emotional depth.  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively excavate root causes early (e.g., \"Whatâ€™s the worst-case scenario?\"). Balance levity with brief trauma-informed check-ins. Tailor strategies to personality (e.g., extroverts: collaborative outs; introverts: low-pressure roleplay).  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Strengthen trauma-informed probing while maintaining accessibility. Refine humor-to-depth ratio. Expand personality-specific frameworks (e.g., high-extraversion vs. high-anxiety).",
