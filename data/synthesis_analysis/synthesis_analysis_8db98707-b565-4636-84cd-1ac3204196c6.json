  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective validation of emotions, breaking tasks into micro-steps, and blending structured scripts with flexibility (e.g., adaptable talking points) consistently build confidence. Normalizing anxiety and using humor reduce pressure.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Delayed exploration of root fears (e.g., judgment, freezing) and underutilized roleplay/physiological cues (e.g., grounding) hinder early progress.  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively address catastrophic \"what-ifs\" sooner, integrate physical anxiety management (e.g., breathing), and reinforce past successes before introducing new techniques.  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Balance tactical scripts with mindset reframes (\"progress over perfection\"), and tailor pacingâ€”gentle pushes for hesitant students, leverage framing for high-agency ones.",
