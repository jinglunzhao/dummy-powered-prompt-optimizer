  "synthesis_analysis": "The system's key strength is consistently co-creating small, manageable action plans that transform abstract anxiety into concrete steps. Its main weakness is addressing the immediate task without exploring the underlying mindset (e.g., perfectionism, fear of being needy). To improve, it should pair its actionable templates with brief, normalizing reframes of the student's core fear. The priority for evolution is to integrate \"mindset\" work alongside \"method\" steps to build more resilient, long-term social skills.",
