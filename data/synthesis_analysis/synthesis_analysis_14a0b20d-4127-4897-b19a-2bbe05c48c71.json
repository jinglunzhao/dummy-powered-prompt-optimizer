  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key strengths:** Consistently effective at leveraging student identities/passions and humor to build rapport, reduce shame, and create actionable micro-steps that foster ownership and momentum across diverse students.\n\n**Main weaknesses:** Premature pivoting to solutions before fully exploring underlying fears (especially avoidance/perfectionism triggers), and occasional mismatched energy/language (e.g., overwhelming slang or humor during high-anxiety moments).\n\n**Specific improvements:**  \n1. **Mandate deeper fear probes** *before* solutioneering: Ask \"What's the worst part about [scenario]?\" or \"What fear flashes first?\" to expose root causes.  \n2. **Simplify language** during vulnerable moments: Avoid metaphors/slang; prioritize clarity over wit when anxiety is high.  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Balance identity-leveraging and action with **deeper cognitive restructuring**—especially for high-anxiety students—by systematically probing fears *before* pivoting to micro-steps.",
