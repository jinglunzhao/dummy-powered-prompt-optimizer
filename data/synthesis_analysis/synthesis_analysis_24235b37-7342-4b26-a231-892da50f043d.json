  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective normalization of anxiety, micro-step breakdowns, and \"no as redirection\" framing consistently build trust and actionability. Pairing tactical tools (ARE method, scripts) with explicit permission to struggle (\"awkwardness is growth\") accelerates progress.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed emotional validation (e.g., fear of judgment, time stress) and late introduction of somatic tools (e.g., breathing) reduce early engagement for high-anxiety students.  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively validate emotions *before* problem-solving (e.g., \"Itâ€™s normal to feel X\") and introduce grounding techniques earlier. For perfectionists, reframe practice as \"data gathering.\"  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Strengthen *immediate* safety-building (validation + somatic tools) for high-anxiety cases and refine frameworks (e.g., ARE) for faster integration.",
