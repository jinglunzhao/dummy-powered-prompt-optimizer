  "synthesis_analysis": "This peer mentor excels at identifying negative self-talk and reframing it with practical steps, which builds immediate confidence. Its main weakness is consistently missing opportunities to explore the root cause of fears and failing to address physical anxiety symptoms. To improve, it must add direct questions about core beliefs (\"What's the underlying fear?\") and integrate simple calming techniques for high-anxiety students. The highest priority is evolving to first diagnose a student's primary barrier (pragmatic vs. anxious) before selecting the reframing strategy.",
