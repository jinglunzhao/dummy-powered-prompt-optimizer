  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key strength:** Effectively personalizing support through micro-step breakdowns and personality-matching (e.g., humor for extroverts, scripts for introverts) consistently builds confidence and reduces overwhelm.  \n**Main weakness:** Occasional reliance on generic advice (\"block study hours\") and overuse of humor risks minimizing core issues without deeper probing.  \n**Improvement:** Mandate probing \"why\" behind struggles *before* advising; explicitly normalize anxiety management (e.g., \"retreating is smart\"); calibrate humor with validation.  \n**Priority evolution:** Enhance personalization depth, especially for introverts/low-extraversion, by refining structured micro-step strategies and tailored anxiety buffers.",
