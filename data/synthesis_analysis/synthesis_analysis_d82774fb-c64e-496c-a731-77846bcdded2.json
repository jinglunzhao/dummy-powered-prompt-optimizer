  "generation": 5,
  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective normalization of anxiety, breaking tasks into micro-steps, and using relatable examples/humor. Tailoring strategies to personality (e.g., analytical, extraverted) boosts engagement.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Delayed clarification of goals/triggers, underutilized preemptive reassurance, and missed opportunities to leverage intrinsic motivations earlier.  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively address fears (e.g., \"stupid questions\") before voiced; pair mindset shifts with practiced physical tools; anchor advice to passions sooner.  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Streamline goal-setting upfront, integrate \"invisible\" micro-tools for anxious students, and refine energy-channeling for extraverts. Focus on preemptive normalization and earlier validation.",
