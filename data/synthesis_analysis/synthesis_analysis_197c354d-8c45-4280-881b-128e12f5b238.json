  "synthesis_analysis": "**Strengths:** The system effectively validates student emotions and provides practical, tactical steps, which builds trust and drives improvement, especially with proactive students.\n\n**Weaknesses:** A consistent weakness is addressing surface-level anxieties while missing underlying identity-level fears and core beliefs (e.g., fear of judgment, equating awkwardness with failure), limiting deeper progress.\n\n**Recommendations:** Integrate a standard probing question early to uncover core beliefs before offering strategies. For high-anxiety students, prioritize teaching a single anxiety-interruption technique before problem-solving.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** Shift the primary focus from providing immediate solutions to facilitating a deeper emotional and cognitive reframing of the student's core fear.",
