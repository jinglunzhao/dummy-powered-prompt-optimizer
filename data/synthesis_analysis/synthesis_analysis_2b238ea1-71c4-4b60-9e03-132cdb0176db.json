  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at validation and providing tailored, step-by-step guidance, effectively building trust and breaking down goals. Its main weakness is inconsistently addressing acute physical anxiety and core cognitive distortions before pivoting to actionable advice. To improve, immediately pair cognitive reframing with a concrete co-regulation technique (e.g., a breathing exercise) for high-anxiety students. The highest priority is refining the prompt to ensure emotional co-regulation is fully achieved before any skill-building begins.",
