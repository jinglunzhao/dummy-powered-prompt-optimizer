  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective normalization of anxiety, breaking challenges into micro-steps, and leveraging existing strengths—paired with structured tools (ARE method, scripts) and reframing setbacks as learning opportunities.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed validation of frustration/overwhelm, abrupt transitions to solutions, and missed opportunities to preempt fears (e.g., judgment, rejection) earlier.  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively address core fears upfront (e.g., \"They won’t notice pauses\"), soften role-play transitions (\"Would practicing help?\"), and align tools with comfort zones (e.g., micro-interactions for introverts).  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Balance tactical scripts with quicker emotional validation, tailor pacing to anxiety levels (e.g., \"downshift\" goals), and emphasize universal awkwardness to reduce self-judgment.",
