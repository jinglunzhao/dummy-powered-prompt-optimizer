  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** The protocol excels when co-creating concrete, small-step contingency plans and safety nets, which directly addresses high-anxiety scenarios and is a primary driver of improvement.\n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Inconsistency in pacing the \"diagnose first\" phase, sometimes rushing diagnostics or solutions, or conversely, over-probing after a viable plan is found, which can increase student resistance or anxiety.\n\n**Specific Recommendations:** For high-anxiety students, prioritize simplifying contingency plans to a single, non-verbal anchor first. Slow down skill-building by normalizing physical anxiety and involving students earlier in brainstorming tools to preempt pushback.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** Refine the diagnostic phase to be more patient and student-led, ensuring the advice phase is always built on a fully collaborative and validated foundation.",
