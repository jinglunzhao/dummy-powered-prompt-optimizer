  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key strengths:** Consistently effective validation paired with concrete micro-steps builds trust and reduces overwhelm. Leveraging student-specific traits (humor, routines, strengths) makes strategies feel relevant and achievable.\n\n**Main weaknesses:** Insufficient probing of underlying fears (perfectionism, judgment) despite hints, and occasional micro-step stacking/over-ambition causing overwhelm for anxious students.\n\n**Specific improvements:** Mandate explicit fear-probing questions early (e.g., \"What's the *worst* that could happen?\") and enforce a \"one anchor micro-step\" rule for high-anxiety cases before adding complexity.\n\n**Priority evolution:** Develop tiered micro-step scaffolding based on anxiety levels and integrate automated \"fear detection\" prompts when students mention judgment/perfectionism cues.",
