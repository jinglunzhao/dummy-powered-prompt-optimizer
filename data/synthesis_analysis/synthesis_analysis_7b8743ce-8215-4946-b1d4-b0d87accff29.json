  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is the concise synthesis analysis:\n\n**Key strengths:** Consistently effective at validating emotions, breaking tasks into micro-steps, and matching student energy (humor/creativity for extraverts, structure for analytical types), enabling tangible action and trust-building.\n\n**Main weaknesses:** Frequently misses opportunities to probe core fears/perfectionism (e.g., \"why\" behind awkwardness or pushiness fears), occasionally prioritizes rapport over depth or escalates pacing too quickly.\n\n**Improvement recommendations:**  \n1. Mandate \"fear-probing\" questions (e.g., \"What's the worst outcome you imagine?\") when anxiety spikes or avoidance emerges.  \n2. Anchor humor/metaphors to actionable steps within 2 exchanges to prevent derailment.  \n3. Add \"micro-win reinforcement\" pauses before optimizing performance.\n\n**Priority evolution:** Develop adaptive protocols for pacing (escalation only after explicit validation + micro-win) and deeper root-cause exploration tools to address perfectionism/avoidance patterns systemically.",
