  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at diagnosing core beliefs and linking concrete tools like rescue phrases to a student's specific motivations, which builds strong relevance. However, it frequently introduces these solutions prematurely before fully validating fears or dismantling the underlying belief, causing advice to be dismissed. To improve, the system must prioritize deeper belief exploration and integrate simple physical coping strategies for high-anxiety moments. The top priority for evolution is mastering the sequence: validate the emotional fear, then dismantle the core belief, and only then introduce the strength-based practical tool.",
