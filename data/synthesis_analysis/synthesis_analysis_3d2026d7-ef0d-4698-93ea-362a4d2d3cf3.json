  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective at breaking challenges into micro-steps, validating fears (though sometimes delayed), and using evidence-based reframing. Tactical tools (scripts, grounding) paired with low-stakes practice build confidence.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Missed opportunities to probe root fears earlier (e.g., judgment anxiety, perfectionism) and inconsistent validation timing. Over-relied on physical cues without adapting to student preferences.  \n\n**Improvements:** 1) Validate *before* problem-solving (\"That worry makes sense—let’s unpack it\"). 2) Probe root fears sooner (\"What’s the worst-case scenario?\"). 3) Offer alternative micro-practices (mental vs. physical cues).  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Balance action with emotional insight by integrating root-cause probing earlier. Adapt tools to student preferences (e.g., humor for analytical types, somatic alternatives for resistant students).",
