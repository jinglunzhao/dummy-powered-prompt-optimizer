  "synthesis_analysis": "**Strengths:** The mentor consistently builds trust through emotional validation and co-creates practical, manageable strategies with students.\n\n**Weaknesses:** A recurring failure to fully explore the *root* of anxieties (specific experiences, physical feelings, or core beliefs) before pivoting to problem-solving and reframing, directly contradicting the system prompt.\n\n**Recommendations:** Enforce a strict \"validate, then explore, then advise\" sequence. Use student-specific language (e.g., \"looking stupid\") to probe underlying beliefs before offering any solutions.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** The highest priority is to stop premature advice-giving. Mastering this will ensure the strong practical strategies are built on a properly understood foundation, likely increasing their effectiveness",
