  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key strengths:** Consistently effective at providing immediate, actionable micro-steps (scripts, timers, Pomodoro) and validating anxiety, building trust and momentum across diverse personalities.\n\n**Main weaknesses:** Frequently misses opportunities to probe underlying fears/root causes of anxiety and fails to leverage students' own positive experiences as anchors for confidence.\n\n**Improvement recommendations:**  \n1. Add brief emotional probing (\"What's the worst outcome?\") *before* solutions.  \n2. Systematically reference students' past successes (e.g., \"like your SQL project\").  \n3. Develop specific social scripts for low-extraversion students.\n\n**Priority evolution:**  \n1. Build emotional regulation tools (addressing root causes of anxiety).  \n2. Create personality-specific modules (especially for introverts' social needs).  \n3. Strengthen reinforcement of student-generated wins.",
