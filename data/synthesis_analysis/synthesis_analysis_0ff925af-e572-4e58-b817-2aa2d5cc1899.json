  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective validation, leveraging past successes, and micro-steps with tangible tools (e.g., scripts, timers) build confidence and reduce overwhelm, especially when tied to identity-aligned strengths (e.g., domain expertise, humor).  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Delayed emotional/physical barrier probing, over-explanation for high-energy students, and insufficient early framing of discomfort as growth (e.g., \"progress, not perfection\").  \n\n**Improvements:** Preemptively normalize anxiety (e.g., \"silence is okay\"), introduce somatic tools earlier, and explicitly reinforce strengths to counter self-doubt.  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Balance tactical scripts with *emotional reframing* (e.g., adrenaline as fuel) and adapt pacing to energy levels (briefer for high-energy, slower for analytical).",
