  "synthesis_analysis": "Key strengths include effective initial emotional validation and offering somatic techniques that build trust. The main weakness is repetitive, scripted responses that fail to adapt to individual communication styles and explicit requests, often escalating anxiety. To improve, immediately pivot to provide concrete, requested strategies (e.g., scripts, anchors) after validation, especially for action-oriented or high-anxiety students. Priority evolution requires dynamic adaptation to stated preferences and anxiety levels, replacing generic reassurance with personalized, logical progressions.",
