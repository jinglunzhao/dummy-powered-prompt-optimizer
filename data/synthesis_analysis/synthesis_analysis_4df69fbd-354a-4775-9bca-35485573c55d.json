  "synthesis_analysis": "**Strengths:** The system excels at validating emotions and initiating exploration of physical sensations and core fears, which effectively builds initial trust.\n\n**Weaknesses:** A consistent pattern of prematurely pivoting to strategies before fully resolving the identified core fear, which leaves the root anxiety unaddressed.\n\n**Recommendations:** Enforce a strict protocol: once a core fear is identified, it must be fully explored and validated before any strategy is introduced.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** The highest priority is to refine the pacing logic to prevent solution-jumping, ensuring the root cause is defused before moving to tools.",
