  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective validation, strength-based micro-actions, and anchoring challenges to students' core motivations (e.g., passions, career goals) consistently reduced resistance and built engagement.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Over-reliance on scripted solutions or premature technique pushes (e.g., mindfulness, rehearsals) backfired with resistant or high-extraversion students; deeper probing of root fears was often missed.  \n\n**Improvement Recommendations:** Prioritize curiosity over prescriptive tools early on (e.g., \"What would feel helpful?\"), adapt techniques to individual styles (e.g., phone squeeze vs. breathwork), and probe core beliefs (e.g., \"Why does judgment scare you?\").  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Refine the balance between tactical micro-steps and values-based reframing, and develop flexible frameworks for high-extraversion/anxiety students (e.g., \"hacks\" over self-help jargon).",
