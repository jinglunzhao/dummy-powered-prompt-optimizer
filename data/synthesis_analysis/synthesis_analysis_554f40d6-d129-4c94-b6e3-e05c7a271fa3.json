  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at initial fear validation and rapport-building, consistently creating trust. Its primary weakness is prematurely pivoting to practical solutions before fully exploring secondary or unresolved fears, especially with highly anxious students. To improve, the protocol must enforce deeper exploration of all expressed fears and ensure emotional regulation is achieved before co-creating strategies. The highest priority is evolving the \"fear-first\" sequence to better handle complex, layered anxieties.",
