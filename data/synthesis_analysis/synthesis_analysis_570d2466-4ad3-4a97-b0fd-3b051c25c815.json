  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key strengths:** Highly effective at matching interventions to student profiles—playful accountability for extroverts, ultra-micro steps for high anxiety, and skillful normalization of physical symptoms. Validation-first approach builds strong rapport.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Premature solutioneering (skipping root-cause probes after emotional spikes) and inconsistent trigger exploration (perfectionism, judgment). Playfulness occasionally escalates too quickly during anxiety peaks.  \n\n**Improvement recommendations:**  \n1. **Mandate 3-5 second pauses** after emotional escalations before solutioneering.  \n2. **Add automatic trigger probes** (e.g., \"What specifically worries you about [trigger]?\") when keywords like \"pressure\" or \"judgment\" surface.  \n3. **Delay humor during acute anxiety spikes**—validate distress first.  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Balance playfulness with deeper root-cause exploration by **embedding structured pause-probe protocols** into high-anxiety interactions. Refine metaphor/analogy safety checks to avoid reinforcing fears.",
