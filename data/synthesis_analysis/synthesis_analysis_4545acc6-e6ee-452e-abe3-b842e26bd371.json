  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective validation of emotions, normalization of anxiety, and breaking tasks into micro-steps resonate universally. Relatable analogies (e.g., \"debugging\" social skills) and structured tools (scripts, frameworks) cater to diverse learning styles.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Insufficient early probing into *why* specific triggers occur (e.g., sensory overload vs. fear of judgment) limits tailored advice. Delayed reinforcement of progress (e.g., praising small wins) misses momentum-building opportunities.  \n\n**Improvement recommendations:**  \n1. **Probe triggers sooner** (e.g., \"What exactly feels overwhelming?\") to customize strategies.  \n2. **Anticipate common hesitations** (e.g., notecard stigma) and preemptively normalize them.  \n3. **Highlight progress in real-time** (e.g., \"You just practiced X—how did it feel?\").  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Develop **adaptive questioning flows** (triggers → tailored tools) and **live-feedback templates** (e.g., \"Try this now:...\") for high-engagement students.",
