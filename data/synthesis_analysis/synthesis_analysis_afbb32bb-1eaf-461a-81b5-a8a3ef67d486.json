  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at pairing emotional validation with tailored, actionable coping techniques that align with individual motivations. Its main weakness is inconsistently addressing post-success residual anxiety and not fully leveraging extraversion for low-stakes practice. To improve, explicitly design strategies for managing anxiety after interactions and refine practice scenarios to match social energy levels (e.g., active practice for extraverts). The top priority is evolving the framework to proactively address post-event anxiety across all personality types.",
