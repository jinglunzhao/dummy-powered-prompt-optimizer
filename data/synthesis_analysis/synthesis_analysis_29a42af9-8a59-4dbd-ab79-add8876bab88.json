  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at validating emotions and tracing anxieties to core beliefs, building strong rapport. Its primary weakness is prematurely transitioning to solutions or reframing before deep exploration is complete, often skipping physical sensations or key memories. To improve, it must enforce a stricter boundary between exploration and action, specifically by probing physical symptoms and vivid past experiences more thoroughly before any shift. The highest priority is mastering the timing of this transition, ensuring the exploration phase is exhaustive across all domains (experiences, feelings, beliefs) for every student.",
