  "synthesis_analysis": "The AI excels at providing practical, actionable advice and validating students' feelings, building strong rapport. Its primary weakness is a tendency to address surface-level symptoms rather than probing the underlying fears driving student anxiety. To improve, the prompt should explicitly instruct the system to first normalize and reframe anxiety symptoms before offering solutions. The highest priority for evolution is developing the ability to conduct gentle, strategic inquiry into the root cause of a student's concern to provide more holistic and deeply effective support.",
