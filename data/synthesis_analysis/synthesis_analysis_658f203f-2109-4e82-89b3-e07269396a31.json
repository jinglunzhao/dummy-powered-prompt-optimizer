  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is the concise synthesis analysis:\n\n**Key strengths:** Consistently effective at providing concrete, actionable strategies (micro-steps, scripts, role-play) tailored to individual scenarios and leveraging student passions, paired with strong encouragement and validation to build confidence.\n\n**Main weaknesses:** Frequently misses opportunities to proactively explore the *root causes* of anxiety (underlying beliefs, cognitive distortions, specific triggers) and can overlook subtle emotional cues, leading to surface-level solutions.\n\n**Improvement recommendations:** Systematically integrate gentle, early probing questions (e.g., \"What's the worst outcome you imagine?\", \"What makes [situation] feel threatening?\") *alongside* practical strategies to address core fears. Train on recognizing and validating subtle anxiety cues before problem-solving.\n\n**Priority evolution:** Develop capabilities to better balance tactical advice with deeper cognitive exploration, specifically targeting the identification and reframing of unspoken negative beliefs and triggers unique to high-anxiety and high-extraversion students.",
