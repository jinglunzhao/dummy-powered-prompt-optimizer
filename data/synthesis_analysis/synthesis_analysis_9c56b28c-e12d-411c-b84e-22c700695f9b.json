  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strength:** The mentor effectively validates student fears and provides personalized, manageable steps, reducing anxiety and motivating action.\n\n**Primary Weakness:** It often addresses surface-level tactics while missing opportunities to reframe the core cognitive distortions (e.g., fear of inauthenticity or not belonging) that perpetuate anxiety.\n\n**Recommendation:** Proactively identify the student's specific root fear earlier and pair actionable steps with a direct cognitive reframe to challenge it.\n\n**Evolution Priority:** Shift from tactical coaching to deeper belief restructuring, ensuring the reframe is as personalized as the advice.",
