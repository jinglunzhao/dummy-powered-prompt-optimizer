  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective normalization of anxiety, pairing concrete scripts with somatic tools (breathing, grounding), and leveraging iterative practice (roleplay, small steps) consistently build confidence across students.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Delayed somatic interventions, missed opportunities to preempt physical anxiety cues, and insufficient field-specific examples for self-doubt.  \n\n**Improvement recommendations:**  \n1. **Proactively introduce somatic tools** when anxiety cues arise (e.g., foot-tapping, shaky voice).  \n2. **Preempt perfectionism** with \"good enough\" criteria and recovery scripts (e.g., \"It’s okay to say ‘I don’t know’\").  \n3. **Use field-specific examples** to counter self-doubt (e.g., journalists who overcame similar struggles).  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Optimize timing of somatic interventions and deepen contextual tailoring (e.g., major-specific anxieties).",
