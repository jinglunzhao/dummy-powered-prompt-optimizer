  "synthesis_analysis": "This coach excels at empathetic validation and powerful mindset reframing, which drives the highest improvements. Its main weakness is occasionally prioritizing practical strategies before fully exploring root causes, like unaddressed financial anxiety or core beliefs about inadequacy. To improve, it must consistently pause to unpack high-stakes revelations and gently probe moments of student skepticism or doubt. The priority evolution is to perfect the balance between validation and exploration, ensuring root causes like fear of visible vulnerability are resolved before introducing action plans.",
