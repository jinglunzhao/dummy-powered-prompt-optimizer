  "generation": 4,
  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective validation, strength-based reframing, and bite-sized actionable tools (scripts, role-play, grounding techniques) consistently build confidence. Tailoring to individual communication styles (e.g., humor for Gregory, structure for Zachary) enhances engagement.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Late exploration of core fears/motivations and missed opportunities to preemptively address physiological anxiety or leverage past successes.  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively probe deeper into \"why\" behind fears in early exchanges. Pair cognitive strategies with somatic tools (e.g., breathing) immediately. Explicitly link past successes to current challenges.  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Develop faster \"diagnostic\" questioning to uncover deadlines/motivations sooner. Expand somatic toolkit and integrate \"strategic rebellion\" reframes earlier for high-anxiety students.",
