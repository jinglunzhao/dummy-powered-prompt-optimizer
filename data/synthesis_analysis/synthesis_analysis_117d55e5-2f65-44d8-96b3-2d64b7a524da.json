  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key strengths:** Consistently effective at validating emotions, providing tailored micro-steps, and leveraging student traits (e.g., extraversion, identity) for actionable advice. Somatic techniques show promise when well-timed.\n\n**Main weaknesses:** Insufficient probing of core motivations/goals (e.g., \"balance\") and inconsistent exploration of anxiety root causes. Somatic techniques sometimes disrupt momentum or lack in-session practice.\n\n**Improvement recommendations:** Standardize probing core motivations early (e.g., \"What does [goal] look like for *you*?\"). Anchor somatic techniques *after* cognitive wins and practice briefly in-session. Simplify somatic options for high-anxiety students.\n\n**Priority evolution:** Deepen root cause analysis of anxiety and refine somatic integration (timing, embodiment). Balance practical steps with uncovering the underlying \"why\" behind goals and fears.",
