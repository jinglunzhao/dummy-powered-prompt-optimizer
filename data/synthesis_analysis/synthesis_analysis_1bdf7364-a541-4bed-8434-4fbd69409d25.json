  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective validation of emotions paired with concrete, step-by-step advice (e.g., templates, small actions) reduces overwhelm and builds trust across students.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Premature solution-jumping without fully addressing anxiety (e.g., urgency, spirals) and missed opportunities to probe deeper into individual stressors.  \n\n**Improvements:** Normalize fears explicitly before problem-solving; add brief grounding techniques and tailored follow-ups (e.g., \"Whatâ€™s worked before?\").  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Balance reassurance/tactical advice for high-anxiety students; train on exit cues (pausing/revisiting) and deeper probing for personalization.",
