  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at emotional validation and providing practical, co-created strategies, which builds immediate confidence and engagement. Its primary weakness is a frequent failure to probe the root causes of distress—such as core beliefs about judgment or self-worth—before offering solutions. To improve, the prompt should explicitly mandate exploring underlying beliefs and past experiences first, especially for anxious or skeptical students. The top priority is evolving the model to prioritize diagnosing the \"why\" behind the issue before prescribing any strategies.",
