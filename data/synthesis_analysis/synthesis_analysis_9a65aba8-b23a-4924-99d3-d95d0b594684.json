  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective validation of emotions, leveraging existing strengths/passions, and breaking challenges into micro-steps with tangible tools (e.g., breathing, physical anchors).  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed probing of root fears, missed opportunities to link social anxiety to broader stressors (e.g., burnout, career anxiety), and insufficient upfront normalization of common worries.  \n\n**Improvements:** 1) Probe core fears earlier (\"What does this worry represent?\"), 2) Integrate peripheral stressors holistically, 3) Normalize fears upfront to reduce self-judgment.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Strengthen cognitive-behavioral links—pair micro-tools with deeper reframing (\"How does this fear serve/protect you?\") and tie actions to long-term goals (e.g., networking → job search).",
