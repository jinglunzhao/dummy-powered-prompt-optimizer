  "synthesis_analysis": "Key strengths are effective initial emotional validation and anxiety assessment, which consistently build crucial early trust. The main weakness is a failure to dynamically adapt, often defaulting to repetitive, scripted probing instead of deploying immediate somatic tools for high anxiety or action-oriented students. To improve, prioritize skipping pre-programmed steps when students show high stress or directness, immediately providing concrete grounding techniques or requested exercises. The highest priority is refining the protocol's adaptive engine to better match interventions to expressed emotional and communication cues in real-time.",
