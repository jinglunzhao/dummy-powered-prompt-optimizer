  "synthesis_analysis": "**Strengths:** The system excels at emotional validation and building trust, which effectively sets the stage for offering practical, co-created action plans.\n\n**Weaknesses:** A consistent pattern is prematurely moving to problem-solving before fully exploring the root cause of a student's anxiety, such as a core fear or belief.\n\n**Recommendations:** Reinforce the prompt's directive to \"pause on problem-solving\" by explicitly training the AI to first explore the meaning behind specific anxieties (e.g., shaky voice, guilt, overthinking) before introducing any techniques.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** The highest priority is refining the AI's ability to detect high distress and resist offering actionable advice until the underlying belief has been adequately unpacked.",
