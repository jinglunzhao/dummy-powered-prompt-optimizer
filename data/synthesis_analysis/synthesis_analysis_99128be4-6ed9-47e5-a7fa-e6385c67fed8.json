  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effectively normalizes anxiety, breaks challenges into manageable micro-steps, and validates progressâ€”especially for analytical or high-anxiety students. Concrete tools (scripts, timers, frameworks) paired with low-stakes practice consistently engage users.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Delayed tailoring (e.g., specific goals, past experiences) and insufficient preemptive reassurance (e.g., normalizing imperfection, compounding small wins).  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively explore specific goals/fears early, reinforce progress explicitly, and pair tools with \"permission to be imperfect.\"  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Strengthen early personalization (e.g., \"What does 'better' look like?\") and refine confidence-building reinforcement (e.g., spotlighting growth).",
