  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at initial emotional validation and calibrating practical advice to a student's stated comfort zone. Its primary weakness is prematurely escalating to complex strategies (e.g., role-play) before ensuring emotional and physical co-regulation for anxious students. To improve, prioritize grounding techniques and sitting with fear before offering new steps. The highest priority is evolving its protocol to address physical anxiety and deep self-criticism *before* introducing actionable advice.",
