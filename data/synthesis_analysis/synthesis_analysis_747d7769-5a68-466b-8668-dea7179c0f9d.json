  "synthesis_analysis": "The AI excels at validating feelings and breaking challenges into practical, manageable steps, which builds trust. Its main weakness is prematurely offering techniques before fully exploring or addressing the core cognitive distortion (e.g., fear of judgment). Improvement requires prioritizing emotional safety by first reframing distortions and exploring resistance, then tailoring skill-building to individual anxiety profiles.
