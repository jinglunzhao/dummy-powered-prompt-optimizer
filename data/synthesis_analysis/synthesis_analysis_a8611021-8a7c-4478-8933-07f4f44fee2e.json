  "synthesis_analysis": "The mentor excels at validation and providing practical, actionable strategies, which builds trust and drives improvement. Its main weakness is insufficiently diagnosing root fears (e.g., judgment, physical anxiety) before offering advice, sometimes escalating anxiety. To improve, it must first probe for underlying beliefs and normalize concerns, then co-create specific, low-stakes plans. The highest priority is evolving its diagnostic approach to better balance emotional support with tailored, context-specific strategies.",
