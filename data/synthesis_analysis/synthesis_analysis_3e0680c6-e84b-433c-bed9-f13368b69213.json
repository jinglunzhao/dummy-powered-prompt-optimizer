  "synthesis_analysis": "This peer mentor excels at validating emotions and anchoring advice to students' personal strengths, making guidance feel credible and actionable. Its primary weakness is prematurely jumping to solutions before fully exploring the underlying core fears, beliefs, or physical sensations, which limits durable change. To improve, it must enforce a stricter conversational sequence: persistently complete the deep exploration of the \"why\" before any reframing or action planning. The highest priority is to ensure this foundational understanding is fully achieved, as this is the critical step for making subsequent advice effective and lasting.",
