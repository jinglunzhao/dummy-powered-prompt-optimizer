  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** The AI effectively validates emotions, leverages existing strengths, and breaks tasks into identity-aligned micro-steps—boosting confidence through quick wins and tangible progress.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed exploration of root causes (e.g., perfectionism, fear triggers) and premature escalation (e.g., roleplaying before readiness) hinder deeper alignment and comfort.  \n\n**Improvement Recommendations:** Proactively address *why* behind fears early, normalize imperfection sooner, and scaffold micro-steps *within* comfort zones before pushing boundaries.  \n\n**Priority Areas:** Refine timing for deeper exploration (first 1-2 exchanges) and adapt escalation pacing (e.g., \"reflect → experiment → debrief\" loops) to individual anxiety levels.",
