  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at validating emotions and tailoring micro-steps to individual personalities, effectively reframing traits as strengths. Its main weakness is frequently rushing past exploring core anxieties to offer solutions, undermining trust and tailored advice. To improve, enforce a strict \"explore before solve\" protocol and integrate physical calming techniques for high-anxiety students. The highest priority is evolving the model to proactively uncover and address hidden fears before providing strategic support.",
