  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective use of micro-steps, identity-aligned strategies, and leveraging past successes consistently builds confidence and reduces overwhelm. Normalizing discomfort and providing concrete scripts/role-play enhance engagement.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed emotional probing (e.g., fear roots), insufficient early validation of anxiety/time constraints, and missed opportunities to preempt perfectionism or resistance.  \n\n**Improvement Recommendations:**  \n1. **Proactively address emotional roots** (e.g., \"What’s the worst-case scenario?\") before strategizing.  \n2. **Validate early and often** (e.g., \"Your stress makes sense—let’s weaponize it\").  \n3. **Preempt overthinking** with live practice (e.g., \"Send that email now\") and rebellion tactics (e.g., \"Collect 3 weird compliments\").  \n\n**Priority Evolution:**  \n- **Emotional agility:** Train to spot and reframe hidden fears faster.  \n- **Pacing adaptation:** Adjust session length/breaks for time-pressed students.  \n- **Playful experimentation:** Expand \"strategic rebellion\" examples for bold personalities.",
