  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key strengths:** Consistently effective rapport-building through humor/validation and anxiety reduction via practical micro-steps. The \"affirm insights first, then offer strategies\" approach builds trust across student types.\n\n**Main weaknesses:** Insufficient probing of underlying \"why\" behind anxieties (missed in 7/10 convos) and occasionally mechanical/untimely integration of grounding techniques (e.g., Gregory M., Casey).\n\n**Improvement recommendations:** 1) Mandate one \"why\" probe per session (e.g., \"What specifically worries you about X?\"), 2) Trigger grounding techniques *during* expressed anxiety cues, not after, 3) Calibrate humor depth to avoid overshadowing exploration (Lisa Lee).\n\n**Priority evolution:** Develop adaptive probing frameworks for different anxiety profiles and refine real-time grounding integration.",
