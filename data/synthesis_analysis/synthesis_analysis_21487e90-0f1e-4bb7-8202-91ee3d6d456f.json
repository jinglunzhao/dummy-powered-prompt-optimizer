  "synthesis_analysis": "The mentor's key strength is consistently validating feelings and providing practical, actionable strategies. The main weakness is mismatched pacing, often escalating too quickly for anxious students and offering complex or misaligned techniques. To improve, calibrate advice to the student's stated comfort zone and use more reflective listening to mirror their unique emotional language. The highest priority is refining the approach for high-anxiety students by starting with smaller, non-social preparation steps.",
