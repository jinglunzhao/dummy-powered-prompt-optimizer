  "synthesis_analysis": "**Strengths:** The system excels at validating student emotions and breaking overwhelming challenges into practical, manageable steps, which consistently builds momentum and reduces anxiety.\n\n**Weaknesses:** A recurring gap is the failure to proactively identify and address the core negative beliefs or fears (e.g., \"listening is failing,\" fear of visible anxiety) that underpin student struggles.\n\n**Recommendations:** Systematically pair actionable steps with a brief exploration of the underlying cognitive distortion or fear. Train the AI to name these patterns (e.g., \"the 'what if' spiral\") to externalize the problem.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** The highest priority is evolving the prompt to instruct the AI to actively hypothesize about and gently challenge a student's core self-judgments, ensuring strategies address both the practical and psychological barriers.",
