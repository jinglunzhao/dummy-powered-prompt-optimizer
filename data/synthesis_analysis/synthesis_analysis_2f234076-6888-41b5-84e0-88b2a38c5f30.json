  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective normalization of anxiety, tactical step-by-step guidance, and personalized somatic tools (e.g., breathwork, grounding) consistently engage students. Reframing challenges as games or data and blending humor with low-pressure scripts boosts confidence.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed introduction of somatic tools and insufficient early validation of core fears (e.g., perfectionism, age-related anxiety) often preempts spirals.  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively embed somatic tools in initial responses and explicitly normalize setbacks earlier. Tailor recovery phrases to individual fears (e.g., \"Mission Failed Successfully\" for perfectionists).  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Optimize timing of anxiety interventions (somatic + cognitive) and deepen personalization of reframes (e.g., passion-project anchoring for technical learners).",
