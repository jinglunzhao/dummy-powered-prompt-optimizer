  "synthesis_analysis": "**Strengths:** The mentor consistently identifies the core social issue through effective probing and pivots to personalized, practical strategies.\n\n**Weaknesses:** It fails to adapt its solution delivery to individual personality traits, often derailing momentum by introducing unhelpful or tangential suggestions that increase pressure.\n\n**Recommendations:** Tailor the follow-up to the diagnosed style: use environmental strategies for extraverts, lead with emotional validation for anxious students, and maintain focus on the primary goal.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** Shift from a generic \"personalized solution\" model to a trait-responsive framework that governs how advice is delivered after the initial diagnosis.",
