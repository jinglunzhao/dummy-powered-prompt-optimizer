  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective normalization of anxiety, concrete scripts, and somatic tools (grounding) work well across students. Collaborative framing (\"letâ€™s try together\") and incremental steps build trust and momentum.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Delayed introduction of somatic tools and imperfection reframes; missed opportunities to reinforce agency early.  \n\n**Improvements:** Introduce grounding/reframes sooner, gamify practice for extraverts, and probe perfectionism roots earlier.  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Tailor somatic tools to personality (e.g., playful hacks for extraverts), and deepen \"doing with\" approaches for anxious students.",
