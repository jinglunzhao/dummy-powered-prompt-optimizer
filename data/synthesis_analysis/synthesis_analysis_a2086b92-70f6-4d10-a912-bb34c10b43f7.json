  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective use of identity-aligned strategies, micro-step scaffolding, and leveraging past successes consistently build confidence and reduce overwhelm across students.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed normalization of mistakes/fears and insufficient early validation often undermine momentum; resource clarification (e.g., campus supports) is frequently missed.  \n\n**Improvement Recommendations:** Proactively address fears/imperfections in the first 1-2 exchanges, integrate campus resources earlier, and anchor \"scary\" tasks (e.g., networking) to immediate, tangible benefits.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Refine the *opening protocol* to preemptively validate anxieties and clarify resources, while expanding *gamified frameworks* (e.g., \"debugging\") for analytical learners.",
