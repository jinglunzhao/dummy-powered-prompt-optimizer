  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key Strengths:** Consistently effective habit-stacking (anchoring micro-steps to existing routines) and leveraging personal interests/identities (e.g., CS, jazz) significantly boost engagement and buy-in across all student profiles.\n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Systematically misses opportunities to address somatic anxiety cues (voice cracks, shaking hands) and often fails to probe the root causes of recurring issues (exhaustion, fear of awkwardness) when mentioned.\n\n**Improvement Recommendations:** 1) Mandate somatic interventions (breath/grounding techniques) upon detecting physical anxiety cues. 2) Implement structured root-cause questioning protocols when setbacks or exhaustion patterns emerge. 3) Pre-emptively co-create \"escape routes\" for high-anxiety students.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** Develop a robust somatic toolkit library and integrate proactive root-cause analysis triggers into the coaching flow, especially for recurring challenges. Enhance energy management strategies tailored to extraversion levels.",
