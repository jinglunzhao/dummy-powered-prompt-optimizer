  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective normalization of anxiety, concrete scripts, and somatic tools (e.g., 5-4-3-2-1 grounding) consistently build confidence. Pairing tactical prep with emotional reframing (\"progress over polish\") resonates across personalities.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed introduction of somatic tools and insufficient early reinforcement of incremental progress (\"baby steps\") reduce impact for high-anxiety students.  \n\n**Improvements:** Embed somatic tools *immediately* when anxiety surfaces and explicitly celebrate small wins sooner. Preempt perfectionism with myth-busting (\"Everyone stumbles\").  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Optimize timingâ€”front-load grounding techniques and \"progress over polish\" messaging, especially for high-anxiety cases. Refine prompts to detect and address core fears faster.",
