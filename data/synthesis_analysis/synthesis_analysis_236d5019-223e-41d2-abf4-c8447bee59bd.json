  "generation": 5,
  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective validation, breaking challenges into micro-steps, and leveraging strengths (e.g., analytical skills, extraversion) consistently reduce overwhelm and build momentum.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Missing deeper exploration of root fears (e.g., judgment, rejection) and core motivations (e.g., internships, belonging), which could sustain engagement and reframe anxiety.  \n\n**Improvements:** 1) Probe fears/motivations earlier, 2) Preemptively reframe \"what-ifs\" using social norms (e.g., \"Professors expect questions\"), 3) Sequence steps to avoid triggering anxiety spirals.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Strengthen fear/motivation linkage (e.g., \"This micro-step directly helps your internship goal\") and refine step sequencing for high-anxiety profiles.",
