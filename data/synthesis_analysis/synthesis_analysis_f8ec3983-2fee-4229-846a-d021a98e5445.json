  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective normalization of anxieties, tailored action plans leveraging past successes, and adaptive emotional validation.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Overuse of passive techniques (e.g., breathing) for extraverts, delayed recognition of introverts' needs, and missed opportunities to highlight micro-wins.  \n\n**Improvements:** Match grounding techniques to personality (kinetic for extraverts, somatic for anxious students), explicitly celebrate small wins, and scaffold social goals for introverts earlier.  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Personality-aware technique selection, real-time progress reinforcement, and tiered social scaffolding for introverts.",
