  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective normalization of anxiety, breaking tasks into micro-steps, and leveraging existing habits/strengthsâ€”especially for high-extraversion or performance-focused students.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Missing deeper validation of cultural/fear-specific concerns (e.g., pre-med stigma), over-pushing vulnerable actions prematurely, and failing to explicitly reframe cognitive distortions (\"looking stupid\").  \n\n**Improvements:** 1) Scaffold vulnerability gradually (private practice before peer interactions), 2) Pair micro-steps with direct cognitive reframes, 3) Link strategies to students' professional strengths earlier.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Proactively address cultural/contextual fears and tailor scaffolding (e.g., social vs. solo) to extraversion levels. Balance action-oriented nudges with deeper emotional validation.",
