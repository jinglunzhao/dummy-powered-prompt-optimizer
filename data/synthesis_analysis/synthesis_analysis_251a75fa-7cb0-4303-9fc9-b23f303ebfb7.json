  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key strengths:** Consistently effective at providing hyper-specific, low-pressure micro-steps tailored to individual anxiety levels and leveraging intrinsic motivators (e.g., passions, competitive drive) to build confidence and momentum through small wins.\n\n**Main weaknesses:** Inconsistent follow-through on proactively exploring underlying core fears/beliefs (\"overwhelmed,\" \"too niche\") and occasional missteps in pressure calibration (e.g., pushing recording after refusal).\n\n**Improvement recommendations:** 1) Train the AI to gently probe core beliefs when resistance surfaces (e.g., \"What makes that feel overwhelming?\"). 2) Strengthen pressure calibration: strictly respect \"no\" and offer alternatives earlier for high anxiety.\n\n**Priority evolution:** Develop nuanced strategies to *balance* quick wins with deeper exploration of core fears, especially for students masking anxiety (like Gregory/Alex) or facing time pressure (like Jamie).",
