  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective validation, strength-based micro-actions, and reframing fears as testable hypotheses consistently build trust and reduce overwhelm. Linking steps to core motivations (e.g., \"approachability\") boosts buy-in.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Overlooking core fears (e.g., \"sounding robotic\"), pushing too fast (e.g., symposium after small wins), and missing contextual stressors (e.g., time management).  \n\n**Improvements:** 1) Explicitly name and validate hidden fears early, 2) Pace experiments to match readiness (e.g., solo practice before social steps), 3) Integrate systemic barriers (e.g., time constraints) into solutions.  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Balance empathy/practicality by pairing strength-based actions with *specific* emotional validation (\"Your worry makes sense—let’s make blanking less scary\"). Anchor experiments to existing contexts (e.g., study groups) before introducing new ones.",
