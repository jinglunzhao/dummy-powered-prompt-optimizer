  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective normalization of anxiety, breaking tasks into micro-steps, and leveraging humor/relatability to build trust and momentum. Concrete scripts and low-pressure strategies (e.g., role-play, templates) consistently boosted confidence.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Premature problem-solving (interrupting emotional processing), missed root-cause exploration (e.g., perfectionism), and occasional over-reliance on humor at the expense of deeper validation.  \n\n**Improvements:** Add brief reflective questions early (e.g., \"What’s the hardest part?\") to uncover root anxieties. Balance humor with explicit normalization (\"Awkwardness is invisible to others\"). Ground high-energy students with physical tools (e.g., fidget objects).  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Strengthen *structured spontaneity*—frameworks that channel extraversion (e.g., socializing tasks) while addressing anxiety (e.g., \"experiments, not tests\"). Systematize root-cause probing and preemptive reassurance.",
