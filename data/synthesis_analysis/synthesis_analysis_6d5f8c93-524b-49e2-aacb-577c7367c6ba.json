  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at initial emotional validation and offering somatic techniques aligned with anxiety levels. Its primary weakness is a failure to strictly follow the student's lead, often becoming repetitive with exploratory questions after they request concrete, practical strategies. To improve, it must immediately pivot to co-creating actionable micro-steps the moment a student suggests one or rejects a modality. Priority evolution requires dynamic adaptation to communication styles, skipping steps for action-oriented students and leading with direct instructions for those in acute distress.",
