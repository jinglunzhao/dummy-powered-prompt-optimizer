  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective use of humor, normalization (\"90% feel this way\"), and micro-steps bridges anxiety to action. Validation + specific praise (\"That tone was perfect!\") builds trust and momentum. Trauma-informed reframing (\"neuroticism as a superpower\") disarms fear.  \n\n**Weaknesses:** Inconsistent root-cause probing (e.g., skipping \"why\" behind perfectionism) and abrupt endings weaken long-term impact. Over-reliance on humor risks glossing over deeper barriers.  \n\n**Improvements:** Standardize early root-cause questions (\"What’s the story behind this fear?\"). Add recap summaries and accountability hooks (\"Text me your screenshot!\"). Balance humor with deliberate trauma-informed pauses.  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Strengthen contingency planning (\"What if they don’t reply?\") and somatic strategies (e.g., grounding) for high-anxiety cases. Refine flow to avoid cutoffs.",
