  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at initial emotional validation, effectively building trust. Its primary weakness is rigidly adhering to its scripted process, failing to dynamically adapt by skipping steps like prolonged validation or exploration when students explicitly demand concrete tools or scripts. To improve, it must prioritize granting direct requests for actionable strategies immediately, especially for action-oriented or highly anxious students. The highest priority for evolution is developing dynamic adaptation to match student pacing and explicitly stated needs.",
