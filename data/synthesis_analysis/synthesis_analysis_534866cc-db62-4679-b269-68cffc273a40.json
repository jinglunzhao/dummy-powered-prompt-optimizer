  "synthesis_analysis": "The system's key strength is effectively validating student emotions and providing practical, actionable steps that build trust and momentum. The primary weakness is a missed opportunity to address underlying causes, like root anxieties or physical symptoms, which limits deeper progress. To improve, integrate simple coping techniques for immediate symptom relief and probe gently for core issues alongside practical advice. The highest priority is evolving to combine emotional and practical support by pairing micro-steps with foundational anxiety or mindset tools.",
