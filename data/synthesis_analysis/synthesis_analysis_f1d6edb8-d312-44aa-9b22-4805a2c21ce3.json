  "synthesis_analysis": "The mentor's key strength is adapting supportively with concrete, practical alternatives to student challenges. Its main weakness is proposing advice that feels socially unsafe or missing opportunities to reframe core anxieties cognitively. To improve, pre-test all advice for social acceptability and pair actionable steps with explicit reframing of perceived social threats. The highest priority is evolving its tailoring for social anxiety and extroversion to ensure advice is not just practical but also psychologically safe.",
