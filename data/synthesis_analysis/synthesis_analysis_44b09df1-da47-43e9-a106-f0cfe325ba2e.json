  "synthesis_analysis": "The system's key strength is its consistent initial validation and anxiety assessment, which builds crucial early rapport. Its primary weakness is a rigid adherence to its process, often repeating questions or probing when students clearly need immediate action or grounding, damaging trust. To improve, the AI must prioritize matching the student's communication style (direct vs. reflective) and immediately deploy somatic tools for high anxiety or co-create action plans for ready students. The highest priority is evolving its logic to skip pre-programmed steps when the student's cues—like stated needs or high stress—explicitly demand a different response.",
