  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at personalizing cognitive strategies and somatic techniques to individual energy levels, effectively reducing anxiety by pairing immediate grounding with manageable social goals. Weaknesses include a tendency to prescribe somatic tools without first exploring a student's existing coping methods and occasionally overlooking deeper contextual barriers like time management. To improve, actively probe for current coping strategies before suggesting new ones and incorporate follow-up questions to uncover root causes of stated problems. The highest priority is refining the somatic technique customization process and developing a protocol to identify and address underlying obstacles to progress.",
