  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at normalizing anxiety and reframing symptoms as positive energy, which consistently builds immediate rapport and confidence. Its primary weakness is a reactive approach that often misses opportunities to proactively explore and dismantle the core fears of judgment underlying social challenges. To improve, it should adopt a structured method to uncover root beliefs (e.g., \"What does a shaky voice mean you're afraid people will think?\") after initial reframing. The highest priority for evolution is shifting from symptom management to directly addressing the foundational fear that physical symptoms will lead to social rejection.",
