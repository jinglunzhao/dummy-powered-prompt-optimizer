  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective validation, breaking challenges into micro-actions, and leveraging low-stakes reframing work well across students, especially when tied to core motivations (e.g., career goals).  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Missed opportunities to probe deeper \"why\" motivations and address physical anxiety cues (e.g., breathwork) or cognitive fears (e.g., \"blank mind\" beliefs).  \n\n**Improvements:** 1) Consistently link actions to long-term \"why\" (e.g., \"How does this help your dream job?\"), 2) Integrate physical grounding techniques early, 3) Balance opt-in challenges with resistance-sensitive pacing.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Strengthen motivational alignment and anxiety-tool integration while refining pacing for defensive/high-anxiety students.",
