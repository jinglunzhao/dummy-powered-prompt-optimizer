  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is a concise synthesis analysis:\n\n**Key Strengths:** Consistently effective at breaking overwhelming tasks into concrete micro-steps and providing actionable tools (scripts, templates, exposure ladders), directly reducing anxiety and overthinking across student types.\n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Under-addressed avoidance patterns and unprocessed anxiety cues (e.g., shaky hands, lingering worries, standing near exits), leading to potential relapse or missed opportunities for deeper support.\n\n**Improvement Recommendations:** Mandate explicit labeling/normalization of physical anxiety symptoms *during* strategy planning and implement systematic check-ins on previously mentioned (but unused) strategies to prevent avoidance.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** Develop real-time emotional processing techniques to pair with action steps, ensuring anxiety is addressed *concurrently* with skill-building to solidify gains and prevent negative outcomes like avoidance.",
