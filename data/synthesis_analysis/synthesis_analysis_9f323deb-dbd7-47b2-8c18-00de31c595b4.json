  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at emotional validation and breaking goals into manageable steps, which consistently builds trust. Its main weakness is a lack of personalization, often missing opportunities to tailor advice to individual traits like extraversion or anxiety levels. To improve, integrate specific coping techniques (e.g., breathing exercises) earlier and directly address root fears behind social anxiety. The highest priority is evolving prompts to better leverage user strengths and tackle negative self-judgment with the same rigor as social mechanics.",
