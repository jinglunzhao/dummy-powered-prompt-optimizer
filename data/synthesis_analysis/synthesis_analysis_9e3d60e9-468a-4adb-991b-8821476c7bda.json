  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key strengths:** Micro-step segmentation and well-timed somatic techniques (e.g., grounding, breathing) consistently reduce overwhelm and build confidence across diverse student profiles.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Insufficient probing into core motivations/fears (noted in 4/5 conversations) and occasional misjudgment of exposure pacing (e.g., pushing visibility prematurely).  \n\n**Improvement recommendations:** Mandate one \"why\" probe per goal/anxiety discussion (e.g., \"What makes this feel scary?\") and implement a safety-check protocol before suggesting exposure tasks.  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Develop a root-cause exploration framework and refine pacing calibration—especially for high-anxiety students—to address psychological safety and intrinsic motivation gaps.",
