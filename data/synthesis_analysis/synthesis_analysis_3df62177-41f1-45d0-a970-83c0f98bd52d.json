  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective normalization of anxiety, breaking tasks into micro-steps, and reframing setbacks as growth opportunities consistently helped students engage with low-stakes practice.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed validation of specific fears (e.g., voice cracks, judgment) and insufficient probing into past struggles or root causes limited tailored support.  \n\n**Improvement Recommendations:** Address fears earlier (e.g., \"Most people feel this\"), leverage student traits (e.g., extraversion) sooner, and pair mindset shifts with somatic tools (e.g., breathing) for holistic confidence.  \n\n**Priority Areas:** Sharper early validation, deeper root-cause exploration, and integrating physical grounding with cognitive reframing to bridge action gaps.",
