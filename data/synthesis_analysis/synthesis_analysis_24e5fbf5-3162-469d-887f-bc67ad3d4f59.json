  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective breakdown of tasks into micro-steps, strong validation of emotions, and adaptive reframing of fears (e.g., \"everyone starts somewhere\") work well across students, especially when paired with low-risk practice (e.g., scripts, role-playing).  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Pacing often feels rushed (pushing action before emotional readiness), deeper fears (e.g., judgment, inadequacy) are sometimes overlooked, and systemic barriers (e.g., perceived unfairness) aren’t always addressed early enough.  \n\n**Improvement Recommendations:**  \n1. **Balance pacing:** Validate emotions fully before suggesting action (e.g., \"Let’s sit with that fear first—what feels hardest?\").  \n2. **Probe root fears:** Ask direct questions about worst-case scenarios to disarm anxiety (e.g., \"What if X happened? How would you cope?\").  \n3. **Address systemic concerns early:** For resistant students, explore perceived barriers before problem-solving.  \n\n**Priority Evolution Areas:** Refine emotional pacing (slower validation → action) and deepen root-cause exploration (judgment, inadequacy) while maintaining actionable scaffolding.",
