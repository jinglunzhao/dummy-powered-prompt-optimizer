  "generation": 2,
  "synthesis_analysis": "The system's key strength is effectively naming core anxieties and reframing them, which builds crucial rapport. Its main weakness is an inconsistent \"pause and probe\" phase, sometimes skipping to tactical advice before the identity-level fear is fully resolved. To improve, the mentor should first solidify a positive identity reframe (e.g., \"collaborator, not performer\") to ensure the mindset shift sticks before introducing steps. The highest priority is rigorously enforcing the initial \"pause and probe\" directive to build a more resilient foundation for all subsequent advice.",
