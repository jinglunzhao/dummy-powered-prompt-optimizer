Here is a comprehensive synthesis analysis of the peer mentor AI system prompt based on the provided performance data and reflections.\n\n### **Comprehensive Synthesis Analysis of Peer Mentor AI Prompt**\n\nThis analysis synthesizes the performance of the current peer mentor AI system prompt across two distinct student interactions. The data reveals a system with a strong foundational approach but one that lacks the nuance and adaptability required to maximize its effectiveness across diverse student profiles. The modest average improvement of +0.30 points indicates the advice is generally helpful but not yet optimized for transformative impact.\n\n---\n\n#### **1. Overall Strengths**\n\nThe prompt successfully instills several core, positive behaviors in the AI across different conversations:\n\n*   **Supportive and Non-Judgmental Tone:** The AI consistently creates a safe space for students. This is evidenced by its immediate validation of challenges, use of phrases like \"that's completely okay,\" and its overall encouraging demeanor. This foundational rapport-building is critical for effective mentoring.\n*   **Action-Oriented Approach:** The AI reliably moves beyond empathy to provide practical, concrete advice. It offers \"tips,\" \"strategies,\" and steps the student can take, fulfilling the \"provide practical advice\" directive of the prompt effectively. This prevents conversations from stalling in purely venting or emotional validation.\n*   **Effective Use of Specific Techniques:** In both conversations, the AI correctly identified and deployed high-impact mentoring techniques, such as **role-playing** for skill practice (Gregory) and **offering control/pacing** to manage anxiety (Jamie). This shows an inherent understanding of basic coaching methodologies.\n\n#### **2. Overall Weaknesses**\n\nConsistent limitations hinder the AI's ability to tailor its support for maximum effect:\n\n*   **One-Size-Fits-All Approach:** The most significant weakness is the AI's failure to dynamically adapt its style to the student's revealed personality and anxiety profile. It provides a similar style of structured, list-based advice to both a confident, results-driven extrovert (Gregory) and a hesitant, anxious introvert (Jamie), with vastly different results.\n*   **Superficial Problem-Solving:** The AI tends to address the surface-level request (\"how to network,\" \"how to speak up\") without consistently probing for the underlying core belief or cognitive distortion driving the issue (e.g., fear of judgment, imposter syndrome, perfectionism). This leads to advice that is technically correct but may not be deeply impactful.\n*   **Ineffective Advice Sequencing:** The AI often leads with its full arsenal of practical tips. For an anxious student like Jamie, this list can be overwhelming and counterproductive, undoing the good work of the initial validation. The advice is not strategically paced.\n\n#### **3. Pattern Recognition**\n\nThe analysis reveals a clear and critical pattern:\n\n*   **What Works:** **Validation + Tailored Action.** Success is highest when the AI's strategy is consciously matched to the student's personality. For extroverts (Gregory), direct, efficient, challenge-focused advice",
