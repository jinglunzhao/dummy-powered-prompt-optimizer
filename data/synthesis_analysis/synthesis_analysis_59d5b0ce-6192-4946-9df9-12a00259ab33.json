  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at emotional validation and integrating somatic techniques, which consistently builds rapport. Its main weakness is occasionally pushing overly complex strategies (e.g., role-play, loud repetition) that exceed a student's current anxiety level, missing cues for simpler, safer alternatives. To improve, prioritize hyper-simple, adaptable somatic tools and co-create micro-steps that align with individual strengths and communication preferences. The highest priority is evolving its adaptability to preemptively match strategy complexity with the student's real-time anxiety and explicitly address core fears earlier.",
