  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective validation, breaking goals into micro-steps, and tailoring strategies to personality types (e.g., humor for resistant students, scripts for anxious ones).  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed exploration of strengths/past successes, assumptions about preferences, and insufficient early normalization of discomfort.  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively identify strengths/positive history first, clarify student-specific contexts earlier, and pair tactical tools with cognitive reframing upfront.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Strengthen preemptive mindset shifts (e.g., \"nerves = caring\") and adaptive scaffolding (e.g., escape routes for introverts). Focus on *why* behind tools to reduce resistance.",
