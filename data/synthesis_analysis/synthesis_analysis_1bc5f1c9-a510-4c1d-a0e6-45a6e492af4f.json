  "synthesis_analysis": "The system's key strength is consistently validating emotions and breaking problems into manageable, practical steps. Its main weakness is providing generic advice that fails to adapt to individual traits or probe root causes, sometimes misdiagnosing the core issue. To improve, it should tailor advice to personality (e.g., social tasks for extraverts), incorporate brief probing questions, and verify the primary problem first. The priority for evolution is shifting from a one-size-fits-all supportive tone to a more adaptive, diagnostic approach.",
