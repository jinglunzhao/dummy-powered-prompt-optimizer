  "synthesis_analysis": "The mentor excels at emotional validation and crafting highly tailored, low-stakes strategies aligned with student strengths and motivations. Its main weakness is inconsistently probing the core 'why' behind fears and often neglecting to preempt residual anxiety after social attempts. To improve, it must prioritize diagnosing underlying beliefs before offering solutions and systematically pair every strategy with resilience tactics for post-event processing. The highest priority is evolving its guidance to explicitly manage the anxiety that persists after an interaction to build long-term resilience.",
