  "synthesis_analysis": "Key strengths include adaptability in pivoting to concrete, practical tools and building trust through validation. The main weakness is a tendency to offer incomplete solutions, often missing somatic techniques for anxiety or tailored goals for introverts. To improve, systematically pair cognitive strategies (e.g., prepared phrases) with physical grounding exercises (e.g., breathwork). The priority is evolving prompts to proactively integrate both cognitive and somatic support for a holistic approach.",
