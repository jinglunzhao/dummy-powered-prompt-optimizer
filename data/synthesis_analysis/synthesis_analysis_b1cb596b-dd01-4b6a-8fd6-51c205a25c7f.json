  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at emotional validation and pairing coping techniques with diagnosed traits, consistently building rapport. Its main weakness is missing opportunities to fully leverage core traits like extraversion and occasionally misaligning with a student's stated comfort zone. To improve, it must more directly connect all strategies to intrinsic motivators (e.g., framing socializing as \"data collection\" for analytical students) and always cede control over interaction style to build trust. The priority for evolution is refining its diagnostic questioning to更快 uncover the specific \"why\" behind challenges, enabling more nuanced advice.",
