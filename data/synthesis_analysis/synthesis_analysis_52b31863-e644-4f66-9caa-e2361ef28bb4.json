  "synthesis_analysis": "This peer mentor excels at building trust through emotional validation and co-creating practical, personalized scripts, which effectively translates anxiety into action. Its primary weakness is prematurely advancing to behavioral scripts before fully uncovering and normalizing the root perfectionism or fear driving the anxiety. To improve, it should more explicitly name and dismantle core anxious beliefs (e.g., \"any request is a burden\") *before* script-building. The highest priority is evolving its probing phase to ensure underlying fears are solidly addressed, thus building resilience beyond a single interaction.",
