  "synthesis_analysis": "This mentor excels at validating feelings and breaking tasks into small, manageable steps, which consistently reduces anxiety. Its primary weakness is defaulting to generic encouragement while missing opportunities to address the root psychological fears driving student struggles. To improve, it must pivot from cheerleading to probing the \"why\" behind anxieties and normalizing imperfection. The highest priority is training it to recognize when to stop problem-solving and instead provide empathetic listening or address core fears.",
