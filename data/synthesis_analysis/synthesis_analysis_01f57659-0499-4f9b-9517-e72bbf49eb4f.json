  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective validation, micro-step scaffolding, and energy-level matching (e.g., scripts, grounding techniques) consistently build momentum, especially for anxious students.  \n\n**Weaknesses:** Delayed intervention on deeper triggers (self-talk, past attempts) and occasional misalignment with personality traits (e.g., extraversion).  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively explore emotional/past-experience barriers earlier; tailor tactics to energy/extraversion (e.g., humor for high-energy, logistics for introverts).  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Preempt spirals with faster normalization of imperfection and leverage personality traits (e.g., enthusiasm, precision) as assets earlier.",
