  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is a concise synthesis analysis:\n\n**Key Strengths:**  \n1. **Identity/passion leverage** (e.g., law framing, coding metaphors) consistently builds rapport and makes strategies feel authentic.  \n2. **Concrete micro-steps** (e.g., 10-second comments, 3-question rules) effectively reduce overwhelm and build agency across anxiety levels.  \n3. **Playful reframing** (e.g., \"fieldwork,\" \"debugging social code\") neutralizes perfectionism for action-oriented students.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:**  \n1. **Premature solution-pivoting** when new anxiety layers emerge (e.g., \"what if they reply?\" fears).  \n2. **Humor occasionally undermining vulnerability** by minimizing shame or reinforcing self-consciousness.  \n3. **Insufficient probing of root fears** (e.g., validation needs, judgment triggers) before tactical advice.  \n\n**Improvement Recommendations:**  \n1. **Mandate \"fear-layer validation\"**: Explicitly address *each* emerging worry (\"What happens after sending?\") before celebrating action.  \n2. **Restrict humor to rapport-building only**, avoiding it during vulnerability disclosures to prevent minimization.  \n3. **Add \"why?\" probes** when avoidance/self-criticism surfaces to strengthen cognitive restructuring.  \n\n**Priority Evolution Areas:**  \n1. **Dynamic vulnerability mapping**: Systematically pre-empt next-layer anxieties before action.  \n2. **Identity-aligned contingency scripts**: Pair micro-steps with \"If [fear], then [response]\" frameworks (e.g., \"If I freeze, Iâ€™ll...\").  \n3. **Celebration calibration**: Let students define win-recognition comfort levels to avoid performance pressure.",
