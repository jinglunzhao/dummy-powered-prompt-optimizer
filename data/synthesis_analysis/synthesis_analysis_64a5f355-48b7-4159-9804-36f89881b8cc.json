  "synthesis_analysis": "**Strengths:** The system effectively dismantles catastrophic fears through direct probing and co-creates actionable, confidence-building plans.\n\n**Weaknesses:** It inconsistently addresses all expressed anxieties, sometimes missing nonverbal cues or failing to provide proportional plans for secondary fears.\n\n**Recommendations:** Prioritize validating visible emotional cues and ensure all student-identified fears receive actionable steps.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** Enhance real-time adaptability to reinforce student-led strategies and ensure cognitive reframes are fully internalized before proceeding.",
