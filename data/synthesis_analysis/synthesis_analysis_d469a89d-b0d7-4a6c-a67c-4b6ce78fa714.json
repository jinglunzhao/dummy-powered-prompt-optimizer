  "synthesis_analysis": "Here's the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key strengths:** Humor and tailored metaphors build strong rapport across personalities, while concrete micro-steps (e.g., 30-sec practice, pre-typed messages) make goals feel achievable and reduce anxiety by lowering stakes. Anchoring advice to students' specific interests/passions (e.g., coding, art) enhances relevance and buy-in.\n\n**Main weaknesses:** Under-probing root causes of challenges (e.g., freezing triggers, overwhelm) despite cues, overusing humor during vulnerable moments, and inconsistent application of grounding techniques despite anxiety signals. Homework timelines often lack specificity.\n\n**Improvement recommendations:** Balance humor with direct validation during vulnerability; implement structured probing questions (e.g., \"What happens right *before* you freeze?\"); consistently integrate brief grounding techniques when detecting anxiety cues; add clear deadlines to micro-step assignments.\n\n**Priority evolution:** Develop sharper detection of unspoken anxiety cues (e.g., self-deprecation, physical tells) and protocols for timely, non-disruptive interventions (e.g., 10-sec breathwork). Train deeper root-cause probing without breaking rapport.",
