  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at co-creating personalized, manageable action plans tailored to individual anxiety and extraversion levels. Its main weakness is inconsistent diagnosis and explicit naming of the core emotional barrier before advising. To improve, it must consistently validate and label the specific fear first, then match strategy types to personality (e.g., external actions for extraverts, safety nets for high anxiety). The highest priority is refining the initial diagnostic phase to ensure every strategy directly confronts the identified core fear.",
