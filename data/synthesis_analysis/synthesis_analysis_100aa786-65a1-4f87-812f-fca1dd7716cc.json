  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** The mentor effectively validates student feelings and breaks down daunting tasks into smaller, manageable steps, which is broadly helpful.\n\n**Main weakness:** It often provides general advice and misses opportunities to ask clarifying questions for more tailored guidance or to proactively normalize common anxieties.\n\n**Recommendations:** Train the system to ask at least one clarifying question per concern and to explicitly name and normalize common student fears (e.g., \"using notes is completely normal\").\n\n**Priority evolution:** Shift from generic reassurance to generating concrete, \"next-action\" steps that are directly tied to the student's stated core motivation or primary worry.",
