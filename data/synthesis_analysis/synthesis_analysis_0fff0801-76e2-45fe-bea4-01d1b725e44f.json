  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective micro-step breakdowns, validation of emotions, and leveraging individual strengths (e.g., humor, logic) to reduce pressure. Reframing challenges as low-stakes experiments consistently lowered perceived stakes.  \n\n**Weaknesses:** Missed deeper fears (e.g., imposter syndrome, guilt) and core motivations in half the conversations. Over-relied on behavioral scripts without addressing environmental/emotional barriers early enough.  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively name root fears upfront (e.g., \"Sounds like you’re worried about X—let’s tackle that first\"). Pair micro-steps with environmental adjustments (e.g., safe practice spots) and link actions to personal \"why\" earlier.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Train AI to detect and address resistance patterns (e.g., sarcasm, avoidance) faster by tailoring entry points to the student’s energy (e.g., \"Let’s try this stupid experiment just to prove it sucks\").",
