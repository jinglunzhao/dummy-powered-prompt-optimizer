  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective validation, breaking challenges into micro-steps, and leveraging individual traits (e.g., humor, research goals) for bite-sized wins.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed probing of root fears (judgment, self-doubt) and underutilized somatic/grounding techniques for physical anxiety symptoms.  \n\n**Improvement Recommendations:**  \n1. **Probe deeper earlier** (e.g., \"Whatâ€™s the worst that could happen?\") to address root fears faster.  \n2. **Integrate somatic tools** (e.g., breathwork, toe-squeezing) with social scripts for high-anxiety students.  \n3. **Spotlight small wins** explicitly to counter negativity bias.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Balance validation with faster root-cause exploration and somatic-anxiety hacks.",
