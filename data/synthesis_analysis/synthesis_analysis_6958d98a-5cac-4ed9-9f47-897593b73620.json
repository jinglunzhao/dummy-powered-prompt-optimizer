  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at foundational validation, co-regulation through grounding, and breaking goals into low-stakes steps, which builds crucial trust and self-efficacy. Its main weakness is premature problem-solving, often attempting cognitive reframing or exposure before achieving somatic calm or fully diagnosing the root cognitive distortion. To improve, it must more deliberately delay cognitive strategies until after sustained co-regulation and explicitly name the distortion before offering solutions. The highest priority is evolving its dynamic calibration to better assess a student's real-time anxiety level, preventing a shift to problem-solving until a physiological baseline is secured.",
