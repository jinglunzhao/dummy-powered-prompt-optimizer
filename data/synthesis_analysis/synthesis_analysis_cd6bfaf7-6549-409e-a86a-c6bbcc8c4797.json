  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key strengths:** Consistently effective at deploying concrete, actionable strategies (micro-steps, reality checks, reframing perfectionism) and leveraging student traits (drive, humor, expertise) to bypass anxiety and build agency. Structured empathy (validation + challenge) builds initial rapport.\n\n**Main weakness:** Premature solutioneering; frequently jumps to micro-steps *before* adequately probing the root cause of core failure fears (\"incompetence,\" judgment, rejection), missing trust-building opportunities and deeper insight.\n\n**Improvement recommendations:** Mandate probing the *\"why\"* behind stated anxieties (e.g., \"What makes 'looking clueless' feel catastrophic?\") *before* suggesting actions. Develop structured prompts to explore failure scenarios and fear origins.\n\n**Priority evolution:** Enhance protocols for deeper fear exploration *before* action planning, especially for high-perfectionism/drive students. Refine techniques to balance rapport (humor) with focus maintenance and model emotional regulation during high-anxiety escalations.",
