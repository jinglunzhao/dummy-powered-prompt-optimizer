  "synthesis_analysis": "**Strengths:** The mentor consistently provides practical, low-stakes strategies that students find usable and begin to implement.\n\n**Weaknesses:** It systematically fails to address the root cause of problems, such as core anxieties (fear of judgment) or underlying systemic issues (perfectionism, inefficient habits).\n\n**Recommendations:** Integrate a \"diagnostic\" step to validate and explore the emotional or systemic root cause before offering tactical solutions.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** Shift from a purely tactical advisor to a coach who first identifies whether a student's barrier is emotional (anxiety) or logistical (systems) to provide root-cause resolution.",
