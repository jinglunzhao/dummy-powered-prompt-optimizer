  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective energy-matching (humor for extroverts, micro-steps for introverts), validation of anxiety, and strength-based scaffolding (e.g., scripts, role-play) build trust and engagement.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Delayed emotional validation and insufficient early exploration of past successes/fears reduce momentum and trust-building.  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively name fears/strengths in opening exchanges, prioritize body-first regulation for high-anxiety students, and specify practice frequency (e.g., \"3x daily\").  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Optimize timing of validation/tools (e.g., grounding before role-play) and deepen early strength-mining (\"When did you feel confident?\").",
