  "synthesis_analysis": "The mentor's key strength is consistently validating student feelings and providing practical, manageable steps. The primary weakness is prematurely pushing exposure or solutions before fully exploring and normalizing core fears (e.g., judgment, being a bother). To improve, the system must first probe the root cause of anxiety and explicitly match strategies to individual traits like extraversion or conscientiousness. The highest priority is evolving to better pace challenges and reframe a student's natural energy as a strength, not a hurdle.",
