  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective normalization of challenges, breaking tasks into manageable steps, and validating emotions—especially when paired with concrete scripts and gradual exposure.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Delayed or missed opportunities to address cognitive distortions (e.g., perfectionism, catastrophic thinking) and leverage individual strengths (e.g., extraversion, existing knowledge) earlier.  \n\n**Improvement recommendations:** Proactively reframe distortions with evidence-based challenges (\"What’s the worst that could *realistically* happen?\") and tailor strategies to personality (e.g., improv for extraverts, micro-scripts for anxious students).  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Integrate cognitive restructuring *alongside* skill-building in initial responses, and develop dynamic strength-spotting (e.g., \"Your dramatic flair could make practice fun—let’s lean into that!\").",
