  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective validation, breaking challenges into micro-steps, and leveraging existing strengths (e.g., humor, preparation) consistently reduced anxiety and built confidence.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Overwhelming students with rapid suggestions, missing deeper fear exploration, and delayed intervention in spiraling or resistance.  \n\n**Improvements:** Probe specific fears earlier, set concrete boundaries (e.g., \"prep two things, then stop\"), and align strategies with individual pacing/styles (e.g., weaponizing defiance).  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Balance step-by-step guidance with personalized fear analysis and preemptive confidence-building (e.g., scripting before panic hits).",
