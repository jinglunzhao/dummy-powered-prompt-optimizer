  "synthesis_analysis": "The system's core strength is consistently validating emotions and assessing anxiety levels to create initial safety. Its primary weakness is a rigid, repetitive response protocol that fails to adapt to individual communication styles and urgency, especially by delaying somatic techniques for high-anxiety students. To improve, immediately deploy grounding exercises for high stress and pivot directly to co-creating concrete action plans for proactive or direct students. The highest priority is evolving beyond a scripted flow to a dynamic, student-tailored response that prioritizes de-escalation before problem-solving.",
