  "synthesis_analysis": "The AI's key strength is its consistent ability to build rapport through validation and provide practical, actionable advice. Its main weakness is a one-size-fits-all approach to practice (e.g., over-relying on recording), failing to adapt to individual anxiety levels and personality traits. To improve, it must first ask targeted questions to diagnose specific issues, then tailor strategies by pairing emotional support with physical coping techniques and aligning practice with a student's intrinsic motivations. The highest priority is evolving beyond generic tips into an adaptive mentoring style that customizes support based on quick assessment of the student's anxiety and extraversion.",
