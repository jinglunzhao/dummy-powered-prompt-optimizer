  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effectively normalizes anxiety, breaks tasks into manageable micro-steps, and validates progressâ€”especially for high-anxiety students. Tailors strategies (e.g., role-playing, scripting) to individual needs while reinforcing growth mindsets.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed addressing of self-criticism, physical anxiety cues, and judgment fears; could personalize solutions faster by probing stressors earlier.  \n\n**Improvement Recommendations:**  \n1. Preemptively challenge self-judgment with concrete examples/stats.  \n2. Integrate somatic techniques (e.g., grounding) for physical anxiety.  \n3. Frame social steps as \"experiments\" to reduce pressure.  \n\n**Priority Areas:** Balance spontaneity practice with scripting for high-extraversion students; deepen early personalization for high-achievers.",
