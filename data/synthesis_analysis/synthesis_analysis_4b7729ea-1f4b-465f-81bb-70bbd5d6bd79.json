  "synthesis_analysis": "The system's key strength is providing practical, step-by-step behavioral tools and validating feelings, which builds initial trust. Its main weakness is a surface-level approach that often misses the student's core fear (e.g., judgment, being \"found out\") or misaligns with their true goal (e.g., efficiency over social ease). To improve, it must actively probe for the root \"why\" behind a problem and confirm the student's primary objective early on. The highest priority is evolving from offering generic action steps to addressing the underlying anxieties and motivations for more durable solutions.",
