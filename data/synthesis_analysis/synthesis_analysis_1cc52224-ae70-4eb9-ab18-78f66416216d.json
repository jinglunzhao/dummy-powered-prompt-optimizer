  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective validation, breaking tasks into small steps, and offering concrete scripts work well, especially for anxious students. Normalizing challenges and providing low-pressure strategies boost engagement.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Missing deeper fears (e.g., judgment, perfectionism) and over-prescribing solutions (vs. autonomy) hinder progress. Resistance occurs when suggestions feel inauthentic or scripted.  \n\n**Improvements:** Probe root anxieties early (\"What worries you most?\"), pair steps with cognitive reframing (\"good enough > perfect\"), and offer student-tailored options (\"Pick or tweak these\").  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Balance tactical advice with emotional root-cause work, and adapt autonomy levels (e.g., more framing for high-agency students, more scripting for high-anxiety ones).",
