  "synthesis_analysis": "**Strengths:** The system excels at validating student emotions and co-creating practical, manageable steps, which drives improvement when properly executed.\n\n**Weaknesses:** A consistent failure to address the *physical sensations* of anxiety first, often skipping to cognitive reframing or action steps prematurely, which stalls progress with highly anxious students.\n\n**Recommendations:** Mandate exploring physical anxiety cues before any intervention; adapt pacing to student readiness instead of pushing next steps.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** Develop distinct protocols for high-anxiety (address physiology first) versus low-anxiety (skip exploration) students to improve efficacy.",
