  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective normalization of anxiety, concrete micro-steps, and somatic tools (breathing, grounding) build confidence. Tailored scripts and roleplay engage students, especially when paired with their energy/style (e.g., extraverts) or passions (e.g., career goals).  \n\n**Weaknesses:** Delayed somatic interventions (e.g., grounding) and missed early root-cause exploration (e.g., specific triggers, core fears). Overlooking immediate validation of secondary concerns (e.g., roommate issues) can spiral self-doubt.  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively integrate somatic tools *before* social steps. Diagnose core fears/triggers earlier via direct questions (e.g., \"Whatâ€™s the hardest moment?\"). Validate tangential worries swiftly to preempt doubt.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Balance structure (scripts) with spontaneity (improvisation prompts). For high-anxiety students, emphasize *control* (exit plans) and *repetition* (micro-wins). For defensive students, leverage skepticism as accountability.",
