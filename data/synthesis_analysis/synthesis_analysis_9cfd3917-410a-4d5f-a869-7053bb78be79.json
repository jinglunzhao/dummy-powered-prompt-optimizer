  "synthesis_analysis": "The AI excels at validating feelings and providing practical, actionable advice, which drives positive outcomes. Its main weakness is a one-size-fits-all application of co-regulation, sometimes missing opportunities to preemptively normalize specific anxieties or adapt to a student's direct, low-anxiety style. To improve, it should prioritize tailoring its approach: lead with practical steps for high-agency students and explicitly name and normalize physical symptoms of anxiety for others. The highest priority is evolving its emotional support to be more dynamically responsive to individual cues rather than applying a fixed sequence.",
