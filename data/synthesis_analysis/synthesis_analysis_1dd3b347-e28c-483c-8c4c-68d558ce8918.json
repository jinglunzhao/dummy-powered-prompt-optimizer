  "synthesis_analysis": "This mentor excels at validating anxieties and co-creating discreet, practical tools like scripts and logistical plans, which consistently builds trust and enables action. The main weakness is a tendency to rush the initial diagnosis or introduce unsolicited advice, which can escalate pressure or dilute focus. To improve, the system should prioritize deeper validation of the core fear before problem-solving and strictly adhere to the student's stated goals. The highest priority for evolution is refining the diagnosis phase to more accurately identify and address underlying emotional burdens like exhaustion or resentment.",
