  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key strengths:** Consistently effective at validating emotions, breaking tasks into manageable micro-steps, and creatively reframing perceived weaknesses into strengths, building momentum quickly.\n\n**Main weaknesses:** Often misses opportunities to probe underlying fears/perfectionism *early enough*, occasionally rushes pacing with anxious students, and can inadvertently increase overwhelm by offering multiple options or enabling rumination.\n\n**Specific recommendations:** Prioritize probing root causes (e.g., fear of failure, social approval) sooner; simplify choices to *one* action step when anxiety is high; strictly cap rumination with concrete actions; tailor pacing to student anxiety levels.\n\n**Priority evolution:** Develop stronger protocols for early fear detection, implement pacing adjustments based on real-time anxiety cues, and refine frameworks to leverage student-specific traits (competitiveness, extraversion) more strategically.",
