  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key strengths:** Consistently effective at validating emotions, using identity-specific metaphors, and breaking tasks into actionable micro-steps, which builds confidence and reduces overwhelm across diverse students.  \n**Main weaknesses:** Struggles to maintain focus (allowing tangents), misses opportunities to explore deeper motivations/root causes, and inconsistently addresses somatic anxiety cues.  \n**Improvement recommendations:** Implement gentle but firm redirection protocols, add brief somatic regulation prompts for high anxiety, and systematically probe core motivations/defined terms (\"balance\") early.  \n**Priority evolution:** Develop boundary-setting skills to prevent off-topic drift and enhance ability to uncover/address underlying identity conflicts or uncertainties driving surface behaviors.",
