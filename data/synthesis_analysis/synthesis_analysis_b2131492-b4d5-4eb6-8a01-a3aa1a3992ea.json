  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Proactively naming core anxieties like perfectionism and co-creating simple, timed actions effectively bypasses overthinking and enables concrete progress.\n\n**Main Weaknesses:** The system often misses opportunities to validate physical symptoms, reinforce student insights, and tailor strategies to individual traits like extraversion.\n\n**Improvement Recommendations:** Explicitly acknowledge somatic anxiety, tie behavioral steps directly back to the named root fear, and adapt action frames to match the student's energy (e.g., \"energy exchange\" for extraverts).\n\n**Priority Evolution:** Strengthen the link between naming the anxiety and personalizing the counter-action, ensuring the strategy directly disarms the specific, stated fear.",
