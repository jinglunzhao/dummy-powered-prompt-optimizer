Its primary weakness is overlooking the physiological component of anxiety described by students. To improve, integrate simple coping techniques (e.g., a breathing exercise) with social strategies and offer preemptive, low-stakes scripts for intimidating tasks. The top priority is evolving from pure tactical advice to holistic support that addresses both mental and physical symptoms of stress.",
