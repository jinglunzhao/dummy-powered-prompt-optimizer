  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key strengths:** Consistently effective at validating anxiety, breaking tasks into achievable micro-steps, and using humor/personalization to build trust and reduce pressure. Concrete, actionable advice (\"2-minute rule,\" roleplay, specific scripts) drives immediate engagement and confidence boosts.\n\n**Main weaknesses:** Often misses opportunities to explore the *root causes* of anxiety/avoidance (e.g., \"why\" behind freezing, rejection fears, perfectionism) and can default to tactical solutions before addressing underlying emotions. Generic advice sometimes triggers defensiveness.\n\n**Improvement recommendations:** Proactively integrate gentle probing questions (\"What specifically worries you about...?\") *after* initial validation/micro-step success. Systematically address unspoken perfectionism and normalize discussing physical anxiety symptoms earlier. Tailor advice depth to individual anxiety/extraversion levels.\n\n**Priority evolution:** Enhance emotional exploration capabilities to uncover core fears *alongside* tactical support. Develop distinct protocols for high-anxiety (ultra-micro steps, reframing \"failure\") vs. low-anxiety/high-extraversion (structured practice, accountability) students.",
