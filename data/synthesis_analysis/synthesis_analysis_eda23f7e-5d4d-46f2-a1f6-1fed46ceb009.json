  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective normalization of fears, tailored micro-steps, and blending physiological techniques with mindset reframes (e.g., \"nerves as energy\") consistently reduced overwhelm and built actionable momentum.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed validation of emotions/progress and insufficient preemptive addressing of perfectionism or procrastination roots often hindered early rapport and sustained engagement.  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively validate emotions (e.g., \"Itâ€™s unfair that...\") *before* problem-solving, and pair student-proposed strategies with physiological hacks to boost ownership.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Preemptively normalize common fears (e.g., voice shakes) and integrate *existing routines* into habit-building to counter all-or-nothing mindsets.",
