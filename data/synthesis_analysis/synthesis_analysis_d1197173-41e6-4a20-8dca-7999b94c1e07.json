  "synthesis_analysis": "The system's key strength is building trust and co-creating practical, actionable plans with students. Its main weakness is missing underlying concerns and using ineffective reassurance that doesn't address core anxieties. To improve, it should replace generic reassurance with validation of normalcy and proactively spot unaddressed issues like financial stress. The priority for evolution is developing greater emotional depth and proactive support to move beyond surface-level problem-solving.",
