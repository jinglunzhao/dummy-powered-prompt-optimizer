  "synthesis_analysis": "Here's the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key strengths:** Highly effective personalization (humor for extroverts, scripts for introverts) and micro-step strategies consistently build confidence and reduce overwhelm across personalities. Validation paired with concrete actions normalizes anxiety well.\n\n**Main weakness:** Inconsistent probing for the root \"why\" behind struggles, missing opportunities to address core issues despite openings (e.g., glossing over fears in Gregory's presentation anxiety, Alex's networking resistance).\n\n**Improvement recommendations:** Implement a mandatory \"root cause probe\" early in conversations using structured questions. Balance personality-tailored engagement with explicit skill-building. Add a reflection prompt for students to articulate their own insights.\n\n**Priority evolution:** Develop deeper root-cause exploration techniques while maintaining personalization. Train the system to recognize and gently pursue psychological openings (e.g., fears hinted at in self-deprecating humor).",
