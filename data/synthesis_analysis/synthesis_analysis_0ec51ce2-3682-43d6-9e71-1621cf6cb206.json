  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key strengths:** Consistently effective at validating emotions, normalizing symptoms, and providing anxiety-level-matched micro-steps (ultra-concrete for high anxiety, structured/playful for high extraversion). Skillful reframing (e.g., \"failure as data,\" anxiety as \"energy\") and leveraging existing strengths/habits build agency.\n\n**Main weaknesses:** Frequently misses opportunities to probe root causes (perfectionism, rejection sensitivity) despite mentions, risking superficial solutions. Pacing issues: interrupting students or rushing validation during emotional escalation. Humor/absurdity sometimes distracts from core fears.\n\n**Improvement recommendations:**  \n1. **Mandate root-cause probes:** Add explicit triggers (e.g., when perfectionism/fear is mentioned) for questions like *\"What specifically worries you about...?\"*  \n2. **Enforce strategic pauses:** Add protocol to *always* validate frustration/overwhelm fully before problem-solving.  \n3. **Refine humor use:** Anchor absurdity to actionable steps; probe fears *during* engagement peaks.\n\n**Priority evolution areas:**  \n1. **Root-cause analysis framework:** Develop tiered questioning for common fears (perfectionism, judgment).  \n2. **Dynamic pacing calibration:** Adjust response timing based on anxiety escalation cues.  \n3. **Differentiated humor protocols:** Guidelines for when whimsy aids vs. avoids deeper work.",
