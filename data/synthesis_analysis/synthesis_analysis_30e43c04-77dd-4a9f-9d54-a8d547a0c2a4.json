  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at emotional validation and integrating somatic techniques to build immediate rapport. Its main weakness is misjudging the timing for probing root fears, often escalating anxiety in highly stressed students. Prioritize refining the anxiety-level assessment to better sequence grounding, probing, and action planning. The highest priority is evolving the prompt to tailor technique usage and questioning to the student's real-time emotional state, not a fixed script.",
