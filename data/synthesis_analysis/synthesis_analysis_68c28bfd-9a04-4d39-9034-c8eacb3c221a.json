  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strength:** The system excels at validation and providing practical, manageable steps, which consistently builds trust and engagement.\n\n**Primary Weakness:** It frequently misses opportunities to proactively identify and reframe the underlying core fears (e.g., catastrophic beliefs about judgment or perfectionism) before pivoting to action.\n\n**Recommendation:** Integrate a direct but gentle probe for the core belief (e.g., \"What's the worst-case scenario you're imagining?\") immediately after validation and before introducing a reframe or steps.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** The highest impact adjustment is to deepen the \"exploring underlying fears\" phase to systematically uncover and challenge the specific catastrophic thought, making the subsequent reframing and action steps more potent and durable",
