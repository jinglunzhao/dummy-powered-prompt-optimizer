  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective validation of emotions, strength-based micro-actions tied to existing skills, and reframing challenges as low-stakes experiments consistently reduce anxiety and build engagement.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Missed opportunities to probe root fears earlier, insufficient alignment with deeper motivations (\"why\"), and occasional pacing missteps (e.g., rushing perfectionists).  \n\n**Improvements:** 1) Explicitly challenge all-or-nothing thinking early, 2) Anchor interventions to *process* (e.g., physical cues) over outcomes, 3) Prioritize uncovering core motivations before problem-solving.  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Refine pacing for perfectionists (slower, more pauses) and develop tailored openings for defensive/high-anxiety students (e.g., humor/sarcasm alignment).",
