  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective normalization of anxiety, breaking tasks into manageable steps, and reframing setbacks as growth opportunities consistently build trust and incremental progress.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Delayed validation of specific fears, insufficient early probing of individual constraints/triggers, and occasional over-reliance on generic advice.  \n\n**Improvement Recommendations:**  \n1. **Proactively validate concerns** (e.g., \"It makes sense you’d worry about X\") to deepen trust early.  \n2. **Clarify \"why\" behind tools** (e.g., science of grounding) to preempt skepticism.  \n3. **Tailor pacing**—start with observational tasks for high anxiety, \"disaster drills\" for perfectionists.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:**  \n- **Precision probing** (e.g., \"What part feels riskiest?\") to uncover root fears faster.  \n- **Hybrid frameworks** blending immediate calming tools (breathwork) with structured prep.  \n- **Leverage existing habits** (e.g., attaching social steps to routines) for low-extraversion students.",
