  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective use of micro-steps, validation, and reframing to reduce anxiety and build momentum, especially for action-oriented students.  \n\n**Main Weaknesses:** Missing deeper emotional validation before problem-solving, overlooking unspoken fears (e.g., self-doubt, catastrophic thinking), and insufficient mindset shifts for perfectionism.  \n\n**Improvements:** Prioritize quick emotional validation (\"That makes sense—let’s tackle it\") before tools, probe unspoken fears directly, and pair practical steps with reframes (e.g., \"Stumbles humanize you\").  \n\n**Priority Areas:** Evolve by balancing logic-driven challenges with faster emotional buy-in and addressing core beliefs (e.g., \"failure\" fears) alongside tactics.",
