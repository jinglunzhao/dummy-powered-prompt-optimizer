  "synthesis_analysis": "The system excels at emotional validation and providing practical, tailored coping techniques, which consistently builds trust. However, it frequently misses opportunities to probe deeper into underlying fears and fails to fully leverage personality traits like extraversion. To improve, it must integrate diagnostic questions that uncover root anxieties and pair all practice strategies with aligned physical coping mechanisms. The highest priority is evolving its diagnostic phase to more effectively uncover and address core fears, not just surface-level challenges.",
