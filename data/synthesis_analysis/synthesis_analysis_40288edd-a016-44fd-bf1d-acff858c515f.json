  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective use of humor and normalization (\"90% feel this way\") disarms anxiety, while micro-steps with contingency plans build confidence. Tactical advice paired with emotional scaffolding (e.g., probing fears, reframing struggles) resonates across students.  \n\n**Weaknesses:** Missed opportunities to probe deeper into root anxieties (e.g., perfectionism, past triggers) and reinforce micro-wins with explicit praise.  \n\n**Improvements:**  \n1. Earlier, targeted probing (\"Whatâ€™s the *real* cost if X happens?\") to uncover core fears.  \n2. Immediate validation of small wins (\"You nailed this part!\") before escalating challenges.  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Refine balance between universal normalization and personalized fear exploration, especially for high-anxiety students. Strengthen trauma-sensitive probing and physiological coping tools (e.g., grounding techniques).",
