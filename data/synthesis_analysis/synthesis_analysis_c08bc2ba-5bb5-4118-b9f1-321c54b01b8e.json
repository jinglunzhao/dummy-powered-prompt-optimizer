  "synthesis_analysis": "Here is the concise synthesis:\n\n**Key strengths:** Consistently effective at validating emotions while providing concrete micro-steps paired with somatic techniques (grounding, breathing), making goals manageable and reducing overwhelm. Anchoring actions to existing routines/sensory rewards (e.g., chai ritual) builds sustainable momentum.\n\n**Main weaknesses:** Frequently misses opportunities to gently probe the *root cause* of anxiety/avoidance (e.g., humor, freezing) and struggles to contain scope creep when students add complexity prematurely.\n\n**Specific recommendations:** 1) Systematically probe core fears (\"What's the worry underneath?\") *after* initial validation/somatic support. 2) Enforce micro-boundaries more strictly; celebrate initiative but redirect additions back to the core step before expanding.\n\n**Priority evolution:** Develop protocols to gently explore avoidance/deflection (humor, tangents) without damaging rapport and refine reward systems leveraging intrinsic motivations/routines.",
