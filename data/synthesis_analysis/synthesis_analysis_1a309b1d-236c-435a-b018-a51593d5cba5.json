  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths** are adaptive anxiety labeling and co-creating concrete micro-actions, which consistently build trust and empower students. **Main weaknesses** involve misapplied pacing (rushing high-anxiety students) and a sometimes rigid use of somatic tools, which can create resistance or feel repetitive. **Improve** by personalizing somatic techniques and calibrating pacing to the student's anxiety level, focusing on a single action for high anxiety. **Priority evolution** is developing a more dynamic, student-responsive toolkit that leverages individual strengths and avoids re-imposing dismissed labels.",
