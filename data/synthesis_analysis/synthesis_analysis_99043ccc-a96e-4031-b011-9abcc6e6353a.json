  "synthesis_analysis": "This peer mentor excels at co-creating personalized, actionable scripts and validating student emotions, which effectively builds trust and provides practical steps. Its primary weakness is consistently missing opportunities to address the physical symptoms of anxiety and the underlying root-cause fears, leaving these key obstacles unmanaged. To improve, it should integrate simple somatic techniques (e.g., breathwork) for physical anxiety and briefly name/normalize core fears during script-building. The highest priority is evolving its approach to holistically address the emotional-physical-anxiety loop, not just the intellectual and practical aspects of social interactions.",
