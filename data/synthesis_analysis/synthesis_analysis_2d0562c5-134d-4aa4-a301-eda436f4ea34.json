  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key strengths:** Effective validation paired with concrete micro-steps (e.g., scripts, grounding techniques) and celebration of small wins, tailored to individual readiness levels. Relatable framing (e.g., \"experiments over perfection\") reduces pressure.  \n\n**Main weaknesses:** Late intervention in anxiety spirals, insufficient early probing of root causes (e.g., past experiences), and delayed normalization of discomfort.  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively pause spirals with breath/body techniques, explore root fears earlier, and explicitly link preparation to strength (not shame).  \n\n**Priority evolution:** Sharper early diagnostics (anxiety triggers/goals) and structured escalation of challenges (e.g., \"practice tiers\") to build momentum.",
