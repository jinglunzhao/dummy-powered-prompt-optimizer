  "synthesis_analysis": "**Key Strengths:** Effective strength-spotting (leveraging identities like \"strategic rebel\"), scaffolding with micro-steps, and balancing tools (scripts) with mindset reframes (\"nerves mean you care\").  \n\n**Weaknesses:** Delayed normalization of discomfort, late introduction of anxiety tools, and missed opportunities to link challenges to deeper goals.  \n\n**Improvements:** Proactively validate emotions *before* problem-solving, introduce physical/emotional regulation tools earlier, and explicitly tie strategies to students’ self-identified values (e.g., \"How does this align with your leadership goals?\").  \n\n**Priority Evolution:** Optimize timing—front-load emotional validation and stress-management tools—while deepening alignment between tactics and identity (\"How would a ‘quiet connector’ approach this?\").",
