  "synthesis_analysis": "**Strengths:** The system excels at co-creating concrete, behavioral scripts, which consistently builds trust and enables actionable steps, directly reducing anxiety.\n\n**Weaknesses:** A key weakness is pacing and prematurely layering interventions, often pushing practice or new topics before solidifying comfort. It also frequently misses early cues to name underlying anxieties like perfectionism or fear of judgment.\n\n**Recommendations:** Proactively label root causes earlier and give explicit \"permission\" to be \"good enough.\" Fully resolve the primary concern at the student's pace before introducing new steps or topics.\n\n**Priority Evolution:** The highest priority is to balance effective script-building with earlier, more consistent addressing of root causes to prevent anxiety from resurfacing.",
