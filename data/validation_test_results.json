First off, it’s awesome that you’re recognizing these challenges and wanting to grow—that’s a huge step. Since you’re already extroverted and open, you’ve got a great foundation for tackling public speaking and social situations. Here’s what I’d suggest:\\n\\n1. **Public Speaking**: Start small! Join a club like Toastmasters (many campuses have chapters) or even a debate team. If that feels like too much, practice by speaking up more in smaller discussion sections or study groups. The more you do it, the more natural it’ll feel. Also, check if your school offers workshops—they often have great tips on managing nerves.\\n\\n2. **Large', timestamp=datetime.datetime(2025, 10, 4, 19, 9, 6, 911677), metadata={'round': 1}, ai_reasoning=None, ai_final_response=None), ConversationTurn(speaker='dummy', message='lecture halls**: I totally get that—they can feel intimidating. Try sitting closer to the front or near someone you recognize from a smaller class. It makes the space feel less anonymous. And if participation is part of your grade, prep a question or comment ahead of time so you feel ready to jump in.  \\n\\n3. **Dining hall stress**: Maybe go during off-peak hours at first, or bring a friend as a \"buffer.\" Over time, you’ll get used to the chaos—it’s all about exposure.  \\n\\nFor balancing everything, have you tried time-blocking?
