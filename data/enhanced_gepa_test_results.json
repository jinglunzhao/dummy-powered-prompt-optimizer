You’ve already shown great initiative by wanting to pursue these goals (remember how you aced that group project while volunteering last semester?).  \n\nFor time management: Try blocking out 2-3 weekly \"power hours\" just for internship applications, using the Pomodoro technique (25 mins work, 5 mins break). For the student org, start small—recruit 2-3 friends first (your agreeableness will help here!).  \n\nWhich goal feels most urgent? We can build a step-by-step plan together.",
