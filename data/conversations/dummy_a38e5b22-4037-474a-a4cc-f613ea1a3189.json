What if you thought of your presentation as telling a story—something you're passionate and knowledgeable about? Sometimes that shift in mindset can ease some of the pressure.\n\nAlso, have you tried practicing in front of a mirror or recording yourself?

Instead of recording a full presentation, maybe start with just 30 seconds of talking about something you’re comfortable with—like a hobby or a topic you enjoy.

First off, I want to say that it takes a lot of courage to reach out and work on something you're struggling with—especially when it comes to social skills. I'm here to listen and help however I can.\n\nLet's start by taking it slow. What specifically about social situations feels challenging for you right now?

It sounds like you’re putting a lot of pressure on yourself to say the “right” thing, which can definitely make your mind go blank.\n\nOne thing that might help is having a few go-to conversation starters ready. They don’t have to be complicated—something simple like, “How’s your semester going so far?” or “What brought you to this event?” can work really well. Would you be open to practicing one or two of those with me now?",

It takes a lot of courage to share that, and I want you to know that it's okay to feel that way. Many people, even seasoned professionals, have moments like these.\n\nLet's break it down: what do you think was the hardest part for you during that presentation?

It's common for our minds to go into overdrive when we feel like we're being judged—it's our brain's way of trying to protect us, even if it doesn't always help in the moment. You're not alone in feeling this way.\n\nOne thing that might help is practicing grounding techniques. For example, before you speak, try taking a slow, deep breath and focusing on one friendly face in the audience—or even just an object in the room. It can help bring you back to the present instead of getting lost in those anxious thoughts.\n\nWould you be open to trying a short practice exercise with me now?

It's great to meet you, and I want you to know that it takes a lot of courage to reach out and work on your social skills—especially when you're dealing with social anxiety. I'm here to support you, and we can take this at whatever pace feels comfortable for you.\n\nLet’s start by focusing on what you’d like to get out of our conversation today. Is there a specific social situation you’re finding challenging, or are you looking for general tips to feel more at ease when interacting with others?",

Let's break it down into manageable steps.\n\nFirst, preparation is your best friend. The more familiar you are with your material, the less likely you are to blank out. Try practicing your presentation out loud, maybe even record yourself. That way, you can get used to hearing your own voice and catch any spots where you might stumble.\n\nSecond, breathing techniques can be a game-changer. When you feel panic rising, take a slow, deep breath in through your nose for four counts, hold for four, and exhale slowly through your mouth for six. This calms your nervous system and gives your brain a moment to reset.\n\nWould you like to try practicing a short part of a presentation with me now, just to ease into it? No pressure at all—we can keep it super low-key.",

Shaking and feeling overwhelmed is your body’s natural response to stress, and it doesn’t mean you’re failing.\n\nHow about we try something even smaller and gentler next time? Maybe start by just talking through your presentation out loud when you’re alone—no recording, no pressure. You could even practice in front of a mirror for just a minute or two. The goal isn’t perfection; it’s just getting comfortable with the sound of your own voice in that context.\n\nWould that feel doable for you?",

How about starting with something even simpler, like practicing your presentation while looking at a photo of someone you feel safe with, or even just speaking to an empty chair? The idea is to create a sense of safety while you practice.\n\nAnd if you do start to panic, remember: it’s okay to pause, take a slow breath, and remind yourself that you’re in control. You can always step away and come back to it later. Progress isn’t about pushing through panic—it’s about gently expanding your comfort zone.\n\nWould you like to try one of those ideas, or is there another way you think might feel more manageable for you?",

Let's start by getting to know a little more about what you'd like to work on. \n\nWhat specific social situations feel most challenging for you right now? For example, is it starting conversations, speaking up in class, or maybe making connections with classmates?",

The fact that you’re aware of it and want to improve is a huge step.\n\nOne thing that might help is practicing in a low-pressure environment first. Have you tried recording yourself giving a short presentation, or practicing in front of a mirror or a trusted friend? It can help you get used to the feeling of speaking out loud without the pressure of an audience.\n\nAlso, breaking your presentation into smaller chunks and focusing on one part at a time can make it feel less overwhelming. Would you be open to trying something like that?",

You’re already thinking creatively about solutions, and that’s a great sign.\n\nAnother tip: try timing yourself for just one or two minutes at first. You don’t have to do the whole presentation right away. Even practicing your introduction a few times can make a big difference.\n\nHow does that sound?

Real presentations sometimes have unexpected moments too, so you’re actually preparing for the real thing in a really clever way.\n\nAnd hey, if it helps, you can even reward yourself (and maybe your cat) after each practice session. Little celebrations make it feel more positive.\n\nYou’ve got a solid plan: start small, keep it low-pressure, and be kind to yourself. I believe you can do this.

That’s a really common experience with social anxiety, and it’s okay that it felt overwhelming.\n\nOne thing that might help is shifting your focus from what others *might* be thinking to what you’re actually saying or doing. For example, before you speak, you could take a quiet breath and remind yourself: “I’m here to share what I know, and that’s enough.” Would you be open to trying a small grounding technique next time, like focusing on your feet flat on the floor or your breath, to help bring you back to the present moment?",

Forgetting to breathe or feeling like you can’t catch your breath is a classic panic response, and it’s okay. The good news is, there are simple techniques to help you regain control in those moments.\n\nOne thing you could try is the 4-7-8 breathing method: breathe in quietly through your nose for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 7 seconds, and then exhale slowly through your mouth for 8 seconds. It helps calm your nervous system and gives your mind something concrete to focus on instead of the anxiety. Would you like to practice it together right now? We can take it slow.",

Let’s try a couple of strategies to help you feel more confident:\n\n1. **Practice out loud, even if it’s just to yourself.** Hearing your own voice can make the material feel more familiar and reduce the chances of your mind going blank.  \n2. **Try the “chunking” method:** Break your presentation into smaller sections and practice one part at a time. That way, even if you feel nervous, you can focus on just getting through one piece.  \n3. **Use visual cues:** Maybe put a few bullet points on notecards instead of full sentences—just enough to jog your memory without overwhelming you.\n\nWould you be open to trying one of these before our next chat?",

          "content": "That’s a really thoughtful concern, Casey—and it’s totally valid. Messy handwriting or dropping cards can feel like a big deal in the moment, but there are ways to work around that!\n\nHow about trying **digital notecards** on your phone or tablet? That way, you can type them clearly, and they’ll be easy to read. Plus, if you drop your device, it’s probably sturdier than paper! You could even use the “notes” app and enlarge the font so it’s super clear.\n\nAnother idea: **practice holding your notecards firmly** while you rehearse. You could even attach them to a small clipboard if that feels more secure.\n\nRemember, it’s okay if things aren’t perfect—everyone gets a little nervous, and small hiccups are totally normal. What matters is that you’re sharing your ideas, and I know you can do it. How does that sound?",

Here are a couple of backup ideas to help you feel prepared:\n\n1. **Charge your phone fully beforehand** and maybe even bring a portable charger just in case. You could also turn on low power mode to extend the battery.  \n2. **Practice switching between apps** a few times so you feel comfortable reopening your notes quickly if needed.  \n3. **Have a paper backup**—maybe just one sheet with your main bullet points—tucked in your pocket or bag. That way, even if tech fails, you’ve got a safety net.\n\nIt’s totally normal to worry about things going wrong, but having a plan B (and even a plan C!) can really ease that anxiety.

Reaching out for support is a sign of strength, not weakness—especially when you're juggling grad school and personal growth. Let's take this one step at a time.\n\nFirst, let's just breathe together for a moment. There's no pressure here—this is a safe space to explore and grow. Can you tell me a little about what prompted you to focus on social skills right now? Maybe a recent situation where you felt your anxiety got in the way, or a goal you have in mind?",

That sounds incredibly tough, and I want you to know that freezing in a situation like that is a completely normal response when anxiety takes over—it doesn't reflect your abilities or your potential. In fact, the fact that you're here, talking about it and wanting to grow, shows real courage.\n\nLet's break this down together. What do you think was the hardest part of that moment for you? Was it the feeling of being watched, the pressure to perform, or something else? Understanding the trigger can help us come up with strategies to work through it.",

It’s like your brain goes into overdrive trying to interpret what everyone is thinking, and it’s easy to assume the worst. But here’s something to remember: most people in that room were probably rooting for you, not judging. And even if some were, their opinions don’t define your worth or your work.\n\nOne thing that might help is practicing in lower-pressure situations first. Have you ever tried rehearsing your presentation with just one or two trusted friends, or even recording yourself and watching it back? It can help desensitize you to that “all eyes on me” feeling over time. What do you think about starting small like that?",

She’s not there to judge—she’s there to support you. And if you do freeze, it’s not a failure; it’s just a moment where your anxiety got the best of you. Those moments are opportunities to practice self-compassion and try again.\n\nHow about we make a plan together? You could start by just talking through your project with her casually—no pressure to present formally. Maybe over coffee or while you’re both relaxing. The goal isn’t perfection; it’s just getting comfortable sharing your ideas in a safe space. Would that feel manageable?",

And coffee is such a relaxed setting; it takes the formality out of the situation. \n\nHow about you aim for sometime this week, maybe when you both have a lighter schedule? You don’t have to put pressure on yourself to do it perfectly or even all at once. Maybe just start with, “Hey, I’m working on this project—can I run an idea by you?” Keep it low-key. \n\nAnd remember, it’s totally okay if it doesn’t go perfectly. Every small step you take is building your confidence. You’ve got this, Casey. When do you think would be a good day to give it a try?",

Let's take it slow and make this a comfortable space for you.\n\nFirst, tell me a little about what specific social situations feel challenging for you.

The physical reactions you're describing—shaking, racing heart, memory blanks—are your body's natural stress response. The good news is, there are ways to work with it.\n\nOne thing that might help is practicing in a low-pressure environment first.

It shows you exactly where you can improve, and that’s a good thing.\n\nMaybe next time, try just listening to a small part without judging yourself.

It’s like your brain is trying to protect you, but it ends up making things harder in the moment.\n\nOne thing that might help is practicing grounding techniques when you feel that panic starting. For example, you could try the 5-4-3-2-1 method: name five things you can see, four things you can feel, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. It helps bring your focus back to the present instead of getting stuck in those \"what if\" thoughts.\n\nWould you be open to trying something like that before your next presentation or social situation?",

The good news is, grounding techniques can be done subtly—no one even has to notice.\n\nFor example, you could press your fingertips together one by one under the table, or take a slow, quiet breath while focusing on the feeling of your feet flat on the floor. These are small, internal actions that help you recenter without looking obvious.\n\nThe goal isn’t to eliminate anxiety completely—it’s to manage it enough so you can still do what you need to do. Over time, it gets easier. Would you like to practice one of these subtle techniques together right now, just to see how it feels?",

That means you're passionate about stories and information. Maybe try thinking of your presentation as just telling a story to a small group of people who are interested in what you have to say.\n\nWould you be open to trying some breathing or grounding techniques before your next presentation?

You’re not alone in that, I promise.\n\nOne thing that might help is practicing with a friend or even just recording yourself. That way, you get used to hearing your own voice and answering questions in a low-pressure setting. Also, it’s okay to take a breath before answering—even a simple, “That’s a great question, let me think for a moment” can buy you time and make you feel more in control.

But the more you listen, the more familiar and comfortable it becomes, I promise.\n\nAs for the walls, maybe you could practice at a time when your roommates or neighbors aren’t around, or use a closet or a car for a little extra privacy? You could even play some soft background music to help muffle the sound if that makes you feel more at ease. The goal isn’t perfection—it’s just getting a little more comfortable each time.

Even the most confident speakers mess up in practice. The key is to keep going, rephrase, or even laugh it off. It’s all about building resilience.
