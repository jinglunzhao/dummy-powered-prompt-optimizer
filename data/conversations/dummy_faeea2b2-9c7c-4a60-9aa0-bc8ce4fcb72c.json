For time management, try blocking out specific hours for studying vs. extracurriculars - even 25-minute focused sessions help. \n\nStarting a student org? Begin small - find just 2-3 interested peers first. Your extroversion will shine here! For mentorship, reach out to econ professors during office hours; most love helping motivated students. \n\nJob worries? Let's build your network now through campus events (arrive early when it's less crowded if anxiety kicks in). You've got this! Want to dive deeper into any of these strategies?",

      "reflection": "Here's the concise reflection:\n\n**What worked:** The mentor effectively validated Zachary's excitement and initiative while offering specific, manageable steps (30-min blocks, starting in a comfortable seminar), directly addressing his overwhelm and building confidence incrementally. Zachary readily engaged, identifying a safe environment and actionable next steps.\n\n**What could improve:** The mentor missed probing Zachary's underlying fear of \"big crowds\" specifically; a brief, empathetic question about what *exactly* feels overwhelming there could uncover deeper triggers for more tailored support.\n\n**Key insight:** Leverage a student's existing comfort zones (like Zachary's seminar) as low-stakes practice grounds for new skills; this builds momentum by anchoring growth to established security."

Map out your week in advance, assigning specific blocks for classes, studying, org work, *and* downtime (yes, schedule breaks too—they’re non-negotiable!).

Is it the time crunch, or worrying you'll drop balls? \n\nFor starters, try the \"2-hour rule\"—block just 2 dedicated hours weekly for org planning (Tuesdays at 3pm?) and protect that time like it's a final exam. Test it for 2 weeks, then adjust. Pro tip: Pair new habits with existing ones (\"I’",
