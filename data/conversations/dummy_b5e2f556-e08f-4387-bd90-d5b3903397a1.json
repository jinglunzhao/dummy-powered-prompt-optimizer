It sounds like your anxiety is creating a cycle where you're anticipating the worst, and that makes it even harder to feel calm and prepared. I want you to know that many people struggle with this, and it doesn't mean you're failing.\n\nLet's break this down step by step. First, would you be open to trying a smaller, low-pressure practice setting, like recording yourself on your phone instead of using a mirror? That way, you can review it privately and build confidence without feeling judged. Second, have you considered joining a public speaking group on campus, like Toastmasters, where everyone is there to support each other?",

Since you're naturally extroverted and open, we can use that to your advantage. Next time you feel those stares, try this: instead of trying to come up with something \"perfect\" to say, shift your focus outward. Pick one person and silently notice one neutral or positive detail about them—like their shirt color, or how they're listening. It redirects your brain from panic to observation, which can create a tiny mental pause.\n\nWant to try practicing that right now with me? We can role-play a low-pressure scenario.",

Starting a conversation about improving social skills can feel vulnerable, but it’s a brave and important move. Let’s take it one step at a time—you’re not alone in this!\n\nTo get started, could you tell me a little about a recent situation where you felt your social anxiety was especially challenging? Maybe something related to class, your roommate, or just meeting new people? We can work from there.",

The fact that one-on-one feels a little easier is actually a really good sign—it means you *do* have the ability to connect, and your extraverted side is in there, just waiting for a comfortable space to come out. \n\nSince you're studying Communications, I bet you have thoughtful things to say—your mind isn't *really* blank; it's just moving too fast for you to catch the words. What if, before your next class, you wrote down just one small thought or question related to the topic?

But here's something important: *nobody* is judging you as harshly as you're judging yourself. Your warmth and agreeableness mean people probably see you as kind and approachable, not incompetent. \n\nWhat if we reframe this? You don't have to speak in class to prove anything. What if the goal was just to practice feeling a little more comfortable? Maybe start by making brief eye contact and smiling at one person you feel safe around. Or even just nodding when someone else speaks—that's still participating, and it lets your natural extraversion come through in a low-pressure way.

For example: \"I am a kind person, and my presence alone adds value.\" You could even practice in lower-stakes situations—smiling at the barista when you order coffee, or saying \"good morning\" to someone in the hallway.

I want you to know that it's completely okay to feel unsure—many of us feel that way when we're working on something new, especially when it involves connecting with others.

Let's do that now. *(pauses)* How does that feel? Sometimes just slowing down our breath can help calm any nerves.\n\nWhat's on your mind today? You mentioned working on social skills—is there a specific situation or feeling that's coming up for you?",

I’m glad you’re here and willing to work on this.\n\nBefore we dive in, let’s take a quick moment to ground ourselves. Try taking one slow, deep breath in through your nose, and then gently exhale through your mouth. Just one. How does that feel?\n\nNow, tell me a little more—what specifically about social situations feels challenging for you right now? Is it starting conversations, keeping them going, or something else?",

You’re definitely not alone in feeling this way.\n\nLet’s try something small together right now. Place your hand on your chest and just notice your heartbeat for a moment. No need to change anything—just acknowledge it. You’re here, you’re safe, and you’re doing great by even talking about this.\n\nWhen your mind goes blank, it’s often because anxiety takes over. One tiny step you can practice is having a simple “go-to” question ready, like “What’s been the best part of your week so far?” You don’t have to come up with something on the spot—just having one question in your back pocket can help ease the pressure. Would you be open to trying that in a low-stakes situation soon?",

Let’s take another slow breath together—in through the nose, out through the mouth. No rush.\n\nMost people actually love talking about positive things in their lives, so a question like that is often really welcome! And if it feels too big, you could even start even smaller—maybe just, “How’s your day going?” The goal isn’t perfection; it’s just practice.\n\nWhat’s one situation this week where you could try this, even just once? Maybe with someone you feel a little more comfortable around, like a classmate or your roommate?",

Let’s pause for a second and just notice your feet on the floor. Feel grounded? Good. You’re doing really well just by talking through this.\n\nWhat if you tried something super low-pressure, like sending a quick text instead of approaching her in person? Something like, “Hey, no rush—just wanted to say hope you’re having a good day!” That way, you’re not interrupting, and there’s zero pressure for an immediate response. It’s a small, safe step that still counts as practice. How does that sound?",

You’re doing great just by considering this.\n\nRemember: you’re not responsible for how someone responds—only for your kind intention. And a friendly text is rarely seen as “weird.” If she doesn’t reply, it’s almost always about her own schedule or mood, not you.\n\nWhat if you sent the text right before you start a small task—like making tea or reviewing notes—so you have something else to focus on instead of waiting? That way, you’re practicing bravery *and* self-care at the same time.",

It sounds like you're feeling a bit uncertain, and that's completely okay. Many of us feel that way when we're trying something new or working on ourselves.\n\nLet's start with something simple and gentle. Take a slow breath in through your nose, and let it out through your mouth. Just one. You don’t have to force it or make it perfect—just one breath, right here with me. How did that feel?\n\nNow, since you're working on social skills, would it feel okay to try one tiny thing together? Maybe we can think of one low-pressure situation this week where you could practice just saying \"hi\" to someone—like a classmate or someone in your dorm. Would that feel manageable, or would you prefer to start even smaller?",

That fear of being judged or coming across as \"weird\" is so real, and it’s something a lot of people struggle with. Thank you for being honest about what feels safe and what doesn’t.\n\nLet’s try something even smaller and more private. How about this:  \nNext time you’re walking across campus, just try making brief, soft eye contact with one person—no smile, no words, just a quick glance. You don’t even have to hold it. It’s just for you, and nobody else has to know. How does that sound?",

That way, you're still practicing being present around others without the intensity of a direct gaze. It's like a gentle step toward feeling more comfortable. Would that feel a little safer?",

Your comfort and sense of safety come first, always. But just so you know: this is a no-judgment zone, and you can take all the time you need. You’re doing enough just by trying.

Social skills are something a lot of us work on, and it’s awesome that you’re taking initiative.\n\nBefore we dive in, let’s take a quick moment to ground ourselves. Try this: take a slow, deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a second, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. Do that one more time. Sometimes just bringing a little calm to the body can help us feel more present.\n\nNow, tell me a little more—what part of social interactions feels most challenging for you right now?

It sounds really overwhelming, especially in group settings where it feels like everyone else knows what to say. Let’s pause for a moment and just notice your feet on the ground. Wiggle your toes a little if you can. Sometimes reconnecting with our body can help quiet the racing thoughts.\n\nWhen you’re in a group and that panic starts to rise, here’s a small, practical idea: try shifting your focus from what you *should* say to just listening and nodding. You don’t have to contribute right away. Maybe even prepare one simple, open-ended question ahead of time, like “What did everyone think about that reading?” or “How’s everyone’s week going?” You can even write it on your hand if it helps you feel more secure.\n\nWould you be open to trying something like that in a low-pressure",

Let’s take another breath together—inhale slowly, exhale even slower. Good.\n\nFirst, most people are so wrapped up in their own thoughts they won’t even notice small notes. But if it helps you feel more comfortable, you could keep the note subtle—like on a small sticky note in your pocket, or even type a reminder in your phone notes to glance at discreetly.\n\nAnd about your voice shaking—that’s just your body’s way of saying, “Hey, this matters to me!” It doesn’t mean you’re doing anything wrong. In fact, people often find a slightly nervous voice more relatable and authentic. You could even practice saying your question out loud a few times when you’re alone, just to get used to the sound of your own voice saying it.\n\nWould",

Let’s do a quick grounding exercise together: gently press your fingertips together, one by one, and just notice the sensation. Sometimes giving our body a simple, rhythmic task can help quiet those “what if” thoughts.\n\nYou’re not “messing up”—you’re learning, and that takes courage. If you’re concerned about using your phone, what if you prepared just one go-to question or comment *before* you go into the group? Something simple and versatile, like “I really liked what you said about…” or “Has anyone started on the project yet?” You could even rehearse it quietly to yourself a couple of times so it feels more familiar.\n\nAnd if your voice shakes? Own it gently. You could even smile softly and say, “Sorry, I get a little nervous in",

If someone happens to hear, you could even say lightly, “Just making sure I phrase this right!” Most people will think it’s thoughtful, not strange.\n\nAnd about your question feeling “stupid”—I promise, the fear is almost always bigger than the reality. Simple, curious questions (like “What did you think about the assignment?”) are almost always welcomed because they take pressure off others, too.\n\nBut if it all feels like too much, it’s okay to step away for a minute.

Inhale slowly for four counts, hold for two, and exhale for six. You can even do this discreetly if you're in a public space. How did that feel?\n\nWhen you think about social situations, what's one small, specific scenario where you'd like to feel a bit more at ease?

That’s completely normal, especially when you're stepping out of your comfort zone to grow.\n\nLet’s start small and gentle. Before we dive in, let’s take one slow, deep breath together—just inhale through your nose, hold for a second, and exhale softly through your mouth. No pressure to do it perfectly; it’s just a quick reset for your nervous system.\n\nNow, tell me a little about what brought you here today.
