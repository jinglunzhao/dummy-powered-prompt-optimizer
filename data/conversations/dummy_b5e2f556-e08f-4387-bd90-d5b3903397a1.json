It sounds like your anxiety is creating a cycle where you're anticipating the worst, and that makes it even harder to feel calm and prepared. I want you to know that many people struggle with this, and it doesn't mean you're failing.\n\nLet's break this down step by step. First, would you be open to trying a smaller, low-pressure practice setting, like recording yourself on your phone instead of using a mirror? That way, you can review it privately and build confidence without feeling judged. Second, have you considered joining a public speaking group on campus, like Toastmasters, where everyone is there to support each other?",

And I appreciate your honesty—it takes guts to admit when something isn't working for you.\n\nLet's skip the generic advice and get practical. Since you're naturally extroverted and open, we can use that to your advantage. Next time you feel those stares, try this: instead of trying to come up with something \"perfect\" to say, shift your focus outward. Pick one person and silently notice one neutral or positive detail about them—like their shirt color, or how they're listening. It redirects your brain from panic to observation, which can create a tiny mental pause.\n\nWant to try practicing that right now with me? We can role-play a low-pressure scenario.",

You could even play soft background music to help muffle your voice and ease into it.

Starting a conversation about improving social skills can feel vulnerable, but it’s a brave and important move. Let’s take it one step at a time—you’re not alone in this!\n\nTo get started, could you tell me a little about a recent situation where you felt your social anxiety was especially challenging? Maybe something related to class, your roommate, or just meeting new people? We can work from there.",

The fact that one-on-one feels a little easier is actually a really good sign—it means you *do* have the ability to connect, and your extraverted side is in there, just waiting for a comfortable space to come out. \n\nSince you're studying Communications, I bet you have thoughtful things to say—your mind isn't *really* blank; it's just moving too fast for you to catch the words. What if, before your next class, you wrote down just one small thought or question related to the topic?

But here's something important: *nobody* is judging you as harshly as you're judging yourself. Your warmth and agreeableness mean people probably see you as kind and approachable, not incompetent. \n\nWhat if we reframe this? You don't have to speak in class to prove anything. What if the goal was just to practice feeling a little more comfortable? Maybe start by making brief eye contact and smiling at one person you feel safe around. Or even just nodding when someone else speaks—that's still participating, and it lets your natural extraversion come through in a low-pressure way.

For example: \"I am a kind person, and my presence alone adds value.\" You could even practice in lower-stakes situations—smiling at the barista when you order coffee, or saying \"good morning\" to someone in the hallway.
