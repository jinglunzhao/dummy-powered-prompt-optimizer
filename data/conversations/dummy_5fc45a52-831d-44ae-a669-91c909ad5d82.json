Ugh, they can feel like walking into a lion’s den. But guess what? You’re not alone in this. \n\nFor time management, let’s start small. Have you tried the \"two-hour rule\"? Block out just two focused hours a day for your toughest class—phone on airplane mode, no distractions. Then reward yourself with something social or fun. It’s like training wheels for discipline!

Is it the coursework itself, the time management, or maybe the pressure of future goals weighing on you? Sometimes just naming the biggest stressor helps us tackle it. \n\nAlso—side note—your ambition to secure a job or grad school is awesome, but remember: you don’t have to have it all figured out *right now*.

Maybe I'll block out 30 minutes this weekend to do that—and reward myself with boba after? \n\nThe professor coffee chat idea is great too, though my social anxiety kicks in hard with stuff like that.
