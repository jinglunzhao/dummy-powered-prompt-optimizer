      "reflection": "**What worked:** Effectively leveraged Zach's journalism identity to reframe networking as \"interviewing,\" providing concrete micro-steps (e.g., 3 bullet points, texting roommate) that reduced overwhelm. Humor and validation (\"Boom—*there’s* your reframe!\") built strong rapport while naming patterns like perfectionism.  \n\n**Improvement:** Could have probed deeper when Zach voiced core fears (\"not interesting\") earlier—briefly addressing self-worth directly would strengthen cognitive restructuring.  \n\n**Key insight:** For high-extraversion/high-anxiety students, anchor actions to their existing passions *immediately* (e.g., \"sourcing a quote\") to bypass overthinking and harness natural curiosity as momentum."

Instead of diving straight into big career fairs, try practicing with lower-stakes events first, like club meetings or department mixers. You can even prepare a simple \"elevator pitch\" about yourself (just 2-3 sentences) so you feel more confident introducing yourself.  \n\nAlso, remember: most people at networking events are *also* nervous!
