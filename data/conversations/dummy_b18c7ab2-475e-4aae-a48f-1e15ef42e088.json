Something like:\n\n- “Hey, how’s your day going?”\n- “What’s good in the cafeteria today?”\n- “Are you in any interesting classes this semester?”\n\nThese are open-ended but not too personal, and they give the other person room to lead if you’re feeling stuck.

But here's a secret: most people are just as nervous as you are, even if they don't show it.\n\nLet's try a little reframing: instead of aiming for a deep or impressive conversation, what if you just focused on something simple, like asking a question about the event or commenting on the snacks? For example, \"Have you tried those mini-quiches? I can't decide if they're amazing or terrifying.\" It gives the other person an easy way to respond, and takes the pressure off you to be \"perfect.\" \n\nWhat do you think—could you see yourself trying something like that next time?",

Rejection can feel personal, but it's important to remember that people's reactions often have nothing to do with you—maybe they're in a rush, feeling shy themselves, or just having an off day.\n\nHere's a practical tip: if someone does walk away, it doesn't mean you failed. You still took a brave step, and that's what matters. Plus, you can always pivot—maybe turn to someone else nearby or even just give yourself a quiet high-five for trying. \n\nHow about we role-play a quick interaction? I'll be another student at the mixer, and you can practice that snack opener. No pressure—we can stop anytime. Want to give it a shot?",

Most people are so wrapped up in their own thoughts—what they’re saying, how they’re coming across—that they don’t pick up on others’ nerves as much as we think. Your anxiety is often way more noticeable to you than to anyone else. And you know what? Even if someone does notice, it’s okay. Being a little nervous is human, and it can even make you more relatable. How about we try a grounding exercise together?

But here’s something to remember: most people in study groups are focused on the material, not on judging each other. They’re probably just as nervous as you are!\n\nMaybe we can start even smaller. How about trying a one-on-one study session first? Just you and one classmate, working on a problem set together. That way, it’s less overwhelming, and you can focus on the numbers while slowly building confidence in a low-pressure setting. Would that feel more doable?",

It doesn’t mean they don’t like you or think you’re weird.\n\nWaiting until class is a good idea too—you could casually ask someone sitting near you, “Hey, did you get problem #4? I’m a little stuck.” That way, it feels more natural and low-pressure. You’re just two students helping each other out.\n\nAnd remember, you’re not alone in feeling this way.

Starting a conversation can feel intimidating, especially when you're dealing with social anxiety, but you're already doing a fantastic job by reaching out. Let's take this one step at a time—I'm here to support you.\n\nFirst, let's talk about what specifically you'd like to work on. Are there certain social situations that make you especially anxious, like group discussions, networking events, or even just one-on-one conversations? Understanding what triggers your anxiety can help us come up with strategies to make those moments feel more manageable.\n\nAlso, remember that social skills are like any other skill—they improve with practice and patience.

          "speaker": "ai",
          "content": "That's completely understandable, Gregory. A lot of people feel that way—especially when they're just starting out. The good news is, you're not alone, and there are practical ways to make those situations feel less overwhelming.\n\nLet's start small. Instead of thinking about networking events or parties as big, scary things, how about we break them down? For example, what if you set a tiny goal for yourself at the next event—like just introducing yourself to one person and asking them one question about themselves? That way, the pressure is off to be \"perfect\" or talk to everyone.\n\nAlso, have you ever tried doing a little prep beforehand? Like thinking of a couple of open-ended questions you could ask (e.g., \"What brought you to this event?\" or \"What are you studying?\")? Sometimes having a \"script\" in your back pocket can ease some of that anxiety.\n\nHow does that sound to you?",

But here's the thing: most people at events like these are just as nervous as you are, or they're genuinely happy to chat. They're probably not judging your questions—they're just glad someone started a conversation!\n\nAnd blanking out is super common when you're anxious. One trick that might help is to prepare a couple of simple, go-to questions ahead of time. You don't need anything fancy—things like:\n\n- \"What are you studying?\"  \n- \"How did you hear about this event?\"  \n- \"What do you think of [the food, the speaker, the campus] so far?\"\n\nThese are low-pressure and give the other person a chance to talk, which takes some of the focus off you. Plus, people generally love talking about themselves!\n\nWould you be open to practicing one of these with me right now, just to get a",

And looking down is totally normal when you’re feeling nervous—no need to apologize.\n\nNow, let’s try building on that. If someone asked you that same question—“What are you studying?”—how would you answer? Maybe something like: “I’m in Engineering, focusing on [your interest, if you have one]. How about you?”\n\nSee how it keeps the conversation flowing? You’re doing better than you think, Gregory. Want to give your answer a try?",

Have you decided on a specialization yet?\"\n\nThat shows curiosity and gives the other person a chance to share, which takes some pressure off you.

First off, I want to acknowledge that it takes courage to step into a coaching session like this, especially when you're not sure where to begin. Let's start by just taking a breath—no pressure here. What's on your mind today? Is there a specific social situation you've been finding challenging, or is it more of a general feeling when you're around others?",

Talking about social skills can feel vulnerable, but you're already doing something brave just by showing up. Let's take this at your pace—there's no pressure.\n\nSince you mentioned you're not sure how to start, maybe we can begin with something simple: what's one small social situation you've encountered recently that felt challenging or made you anxious? Even something like starting a conversation with a classmate or asking a professor a question after class. We can break it down together.\n\nRemember, social skills are like any other skill—they take practice, and it's okay to have off days. You've got this!",

It sounds like you were really putting yourself out there, and that's something to be proud of, even if it didn't go as planned.\n\nWhen your mind goes blank, it's often because of pressure you're putting on yourself to say something \"perfect.\" Let's try shifting that mindset. Instead of aiming for a deep or impressive conversation, start with something simple and low-pressure. For example:\n\n- \"Hey, how did you find that last assignment?\"\n- \"What did you think of the professor's explanation today?\"\n- Even a simple, \"Hi, I'm Gregory. What's your name?\" can work.\n\nWould you be open to practicing a quick role-play with me right now? We can pretend we're in class, and I'll be the other student. No pressure—just to get a feel for it.",

Now you could:\n- Bond over the struggle: \"No, I’m still stuck on it too—want to compare notes sometime?\"\n- Or even suggest studying together: \"Maybe we could work on it together after class?\"\n\nYou’re doing really well.

It doesn’t mean they don’t like you!\n\nHere’s a reframe: instead of seeing it as rejection, think of it as gathering information. If they say no, you could respond lightly: \"No worries! If you change your mind, just let me know.\" That keeps things friendly and low-pressure.\n\nAnd remember—every \"no\" gets you closer to a \"yes.\" The more you ask, the easier it becomes.

For example, something simple like, “Hey, I was wondering if we could go over the assignment together sometime?” You could even practice saying it out loud when you’re alone.

I’m here to help, not judge—so no pressure at all. Let’s start by taking it one step at a time.\n\nSince you mentioned social anxiety and wanting to improve your social skills, can you tell me a bit about a recent situation where you felt uncomfortable or unsure in a social setting? It could be something small—like talking to a classmate, joining a group discussion, or even just introducing yourself. Whatever comes to mind!",

          "content": "Hey, thank you for sharing that—I know it’s not easy to talk about moments like that. First off, please know that freezing up in those situations is way more common than you might think, especially when you’re passionate or nervous about a topic. It doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with you.\n\nLet’s break it down a bit:  \n- What do you think triggered that reaction? Was it fear of not explaining the project well, or maybe worrying about what they’d think of you?  \n- And how did you feel afterward?  \n\nWe can work together on some simple strategies to help you feel more prepared and confident in those moments. You’re not alone in this!",

That fear of being judged can feel overwhelming in the moment, and it’s totally okay to feel that way. But let me reassure you: freezing up doesn’t mean you’re a failure. It just means your brain went into protection mode, and that’s something we can work with.\n\nHere’s a small, practical idea for next time:  \nTry preparing a 1–2 sentence “elevator pitch” about your project. Something simple like, “I’m working on [brief description], and right now I’m focusing on [one specific part].” You can even practice saying it out loud when you’re alone. That way, you’ll have a go-to response that feels familiar and lowers the pressure in the moment.\n\nHow does that sound? And remember—progress, not perfection. You",

          "speaker": "ai",
          "content": "That’s a totally valid concern—shaky voice and nerves are super common, especially when you’re putting yourself out there. But here’s the thing: most people are so wrapped up in their own thoughts, they won’t even notice if your voice wavers a little. And honestly? A bit of nervousness can even make you seem more genuine and passionate.\n\nHere’s a trick: try taking one slow, deep breath before you start speaking. It calms your nervous system and gives you a second to gather your thoughts. You can even say something like, “Let me gather my thoughts for a sec,” which shows self-awareness, not weakness.\n\nWant to try practicing your pitch with me right now? We can keep it low-pressure—just a sentence or two. I’m here to listen, not judge.",

You don’t have to rush—people will wait.\n- It’s okay to pause and breathe mid-sentence. It actually makes you sound more thoughtful.\n\nWant to give it one more try, maybe just the first part? “I’m working on a bridge design project…” You’ve got this.",

First off, I want to say that it takes a lot of courage to reach out and work on something like this—especially when social anxiety is part of the picture. You’re already taking a positive step just by being here. Let’s start slow and make this comfortable for you.\n\nSince you mentioned you’re not sure how to start, let’s begin with something simple: What’s one small social situation you’ve encountered recently that felt challenging or awkward? It could be anything—like talking to a classmate, asking a question in a lecture, or even just saying hi to someone in your dorm.",

          "content": "That’s totally okay, Gregory—moments like that happen to a lot of people, especially when anxiety kicks in. It sounds like your mind might have gone blank in that moment, which is a common reaction when we feel overwhelmed. Let’s break it down together.\n\nFirst, what do you think was going through your mind right before your lab partner approached you? Were you worried about saying the wrong thing, or maybe feeling pressure to respond perfectly?",

That fear of being judged or saying the wrong thing is really common, especially when you’re high in neuroticism like you mentioned. But here’s something important: most people are so focused on themselves that they don’t scrutinize others as much as we fear.\n\nLet’s try a small, practical exercise for next time. Instead of aiming for a full conversation, just focus on one simple thing: making eye contact and giving a small smile or a nod. You don’t even have to say anything at first if it feels like too much. Would you be willing to try that with someone familiar, like your lab partner, and see how it goes?",

          "speaker": "ai",
          "content": "That’s a really valid concern, and it shows you’re thoughtful about how you come across. But here’s the thing: a nod and a smile are actually universally seen as friendly and approachable—they signal “I see you” or “I’m listening,” not rudeness. Most people will interpret it positively, especially if they know you’re a bit quiet.\n\nIf you’re still worried, you could even follow up with something super simple later, like, “Hey, sorry I was in my own head earlier.” It shows self-awareness and can actually make you more relatable.\n\nHow does that sound? Small steps like this can build your confidence over time.",

Honestly, it might feel awkward in the moment, but it’s not nearly as big a deal as it feels. Most people won’t even notice, and if they do, they’ll probably just assume you’re distracted or thinking.\n\nIf it helps, you can even laugh it off lightly—something like, “Whoops, zoned out for a sec!”—which can actually make you seem more human and relatable. The goal isn’t perfection; it’s just showing up and trying. You’ve got this, Gregory. Want to set a mini-goal, like trying this once with your roommate this week?",

Let me reassure you: most people are too focused on themselves to judge, and many feel just as nervous as you do.\n\nHere's a practical idea: try preparing a couple of simple, low-pressure conversation starters.

In fact, most people at networking events are just hoping someone talks to *them*!\n\nHow about trying a simple, low-pressure opener next time? Something like:  \n“Hi, I’m Gregory. I’m studying Engineering—what brings you to this event?”  \nOr even: “These snacks are pretty good, right?”  \n\nIt doesn’t have to be deep—just a way to get the ball rolling.

It's great to meet you, and I want to start by saying it takes real courage to reach out and work on social skills—especially when you're dealing with social anxiety. I'm here to support you, not judge you, so let's take this at your pace.\n\nFirst off, let's acknowledge something: you've already taken a huge step just by showing up today. That's something to be proud of! Social skills are like any other skill—they can be practiced and improved over time. And you're not alone in this; lots of students, even the ones who seem super confident, are working on similar things.\n\nSince you mentioned you're not sure how to start conversations, let's break it down. What's one small situation where you'd like to feel more comfortable socially? Maybe something like starting a chat with a classmate or asking a question in a study group? We can start there and build from the ground up.",

          "speaker": "ai",
          "content": "That's totally understandable, Gregory. It's amazing how something as simple as saying \"hi\" can feel so overwhelming when anxiety kicks in. Let's reframe this: you're not alone—many people feel that initial rush of nerves.\n\nHere's a gentle approach: start with low-pressure interactions. For example, before or after class, try making brief eye contact and giving a small smile. You don't even have to say anything at first! Just getting comfortable with that can build your confidence. When you're ready, you could add a simple, \"Hey, how's it going?\" or comment on something shared, like the class or an assignment.\n\nRemember, most people appreciate a friendly gesture, and brief interactions like these often don't require long conversations. Would you be willing to try just one of these small steps this week and see how it feels?",

          "speaker": "ai",
          "content": "I hear you, and it's completely okay to feel that way—sweaty hands and all! Let me reassure you: a friendly smile is rarely perceived as \"weird.\" In fact, most people interpret it as warmth and approachability. If someone doesn't smile back, it's almost never personal—they might be stressed, distracted, or dealing with their own nerves.\n\nHere's a little reframe that might help: instead of worrying about what they *might* think, focus on what you're offering—a moment of kindness. You're creating a positive ripple, and that's something to feel good about!\n\nAnd hey, if it helps, practice in a mirror or with a trusted friend first. Small steps build big confidence. You've got this, Gregory. How does that sound?",

It takes the pressure off, and you can even let him know you're working on this if that feels comfortable—sometimes sharing our goals helps others cheer us on.\n\nRemember, progress isn't about perfection; it's about trying. Every small effort counts, and you're already moving forward just by planning this. I'm really proud of you for taking these steps. How about we check in after you give it a try?

Starting a conversation about improving social skills can feel intimidating, but you’ve already done the hardest part—reaching out. Let’s take this one step at a time.\n\nFirst, tell me a little about what specific social situations make you feel most anxious. Is it talking to professors, meeting new people in your classes, or something else? Understanding where the discomfort comes from can help us build a plan that feels manageable for you.\n\nRemember, you’re not alone in feeling this way—many students, especially in high-pressure environments like engineering and law, experience social anxiety. We’ll work together on practical strategies that fit your personality and goals.",

The physical reactions—like sweaty hands—are your body’s way of responding to stress, and it’s something a lot of people experience.\n\nLet’s break this down into smaller, manageable steps:\n\n1. **Prepare a Simple Introduction**: Having a go-to introduction can ease some of that initial anxiety. Something like, “Hi, I’m Gregory, an engineering undergrad interested in [mention something specific, like renewable energy or robotics]. What brings you here?” Practice saying it out loud a few times so it feels more natural.\n\n2. **Set Small Goals**: Instead of putting pressure on yourself to talk to everyone, aim for one or two conversations per event. Even just introducing yourself to one person is a win!\n\n3. **Use Questions to Keep Conversations Flowing**: People generally enjoy talking about themselves. Ask open-ended",

          "speaker": "ai",
          "content": "I totally get that fear—it’s natural to worry about how you’re coming across. But here’s the thing: most people at networking events are focused on their own nerves or what *they’re* going to say next. They’re probably not judging you nearly as much as you think.\n\nIf you forget your intro or feel stuck, it’s okay to keep it simple. Something like, “Sorry, I’m a bit nervous—this is my first event like this!” can actually make you seem more relatable and human. People appreciate honesty.\n\nAlso, remember: you don’t have to be perfect. Conversations are meant to be a little messy sometimes. The goal is connection, not perfection. Would you like to practice a short intro together right now? We can make it feel more comfortable before you try it out for real.",

Let’s build on it just a little so you feel more prepared.\n\nHow about adding one more sentence about an interest? For example:  \n“Hi, I’m Gregory—I’m studying engineering, and I’m really interested in sustainable energy.”  \n\nSee how that gives the other person an easy way to respond? They might say, “Oh, cool! What got you into that?” and suddenly you’re having a real conversation.\n\nWant to try it again with that added bit? I’m right here cheering you on.",

If you want, you can even turn that slight nervousness into a strength by smiling and saying something like, “I’m still getting used to these events, but I’m excited to learn more.”\n\nYou’re doing better than you think.

It might help ground you a bit.
