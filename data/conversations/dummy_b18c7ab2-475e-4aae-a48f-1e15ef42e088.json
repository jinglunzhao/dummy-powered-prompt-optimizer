Something like:\n\n- “Hey, how’s your day going?”\n- “What’s good in the cafeteria today?”\n- “Are you in any interesting classes this semester?”\n\nThese are open-ended but not too personal, and they give the other person room to lead if you’re feeling stuck.

But here's a secret: most people are just as nervous as you are, even if they don't show it.\n\nLet's try a little reframing: instead of aiming for a deep or impressive conversation, what if you just focused on something simple, like asking a question about the event or commenting on the snacks? For example, \"Have you tried those mini-quiches? I can't decide if they're amazing or terrifying.\" It gives the other person an easy way to respond, and takes the pressure off you to be \"perfect.\" \n\nWhat do you think—could you see yourself trying something like that next time?",

Rejection can feel personal, but it's important to remember that people's reactions often have nothing to do with you—maybe they're in a rush, feeling shy themselves, or just having an off day.\n\nHere's a practical tip: if someone does walk away, it doesn't mean you failed. You still took a brave step, and that's what matters. Plus, you can always pivot—maybe turn to someone else nearby or even just give yourself a quiet high-five for trying. \n\nHow about we role-play a quick interaction? I'll be another student at the mixer, and you can practice that snack opener. No pressure—we can stop anytime. Want to give it a shot?",

Most people are so wrapped up in their own thoughts—what they’re saying, how they’re coming across—that they don’t pick up on others’ nerves as much as we think. Your anxiety is often way more noticeable to you than to anyone else. And you know what? Even if someone does notice, it’s okay. Being a little nervous is human, and it can even make you more relatable. How about we try a grounding exercise together?

But here’s something to remember: most people in study groups are focused on the material, not on judging each other. They’re probably just as nervous as you are!\n\nMaybe we can start even smaller. How about trying a one-on-one study session first? Just you and one classmate, working on a problem set together. That way, it’s less overwhelming, and you can focus on the numbers while slowly building confidence in a low-pressure setting. Would that feel more doable?",

It doesn’t mean they don’t like you or think you’re weird.\n\nWaiting until class is a good idea too—you could casually ask someone sitting near you, “Hey, did you get problem #4? I’m a little stuck.” That way, it feels more natural and low-pressure. You’re just two students helping each other out.\n\nAnd remember, you’re not alone in feeling this way.

Starting a conversation can feel intimidating, especially when you're dealing with social anxiety, but you're already doing a fantastic job by reaching out. Let's take this one step at a time—I'm here to support you.\n\nFirst, let's talk about what specifically you'd like to work on. Are there certain social situations that make you especially anxious, like group discussions, networking events, or even just one-on-one conversations? Understanding what triggers your anxiety can help us come up with strategies to make those moments feel more manageable.\n\nAlso, remember that social skills are like any other skill—they improve with practice and patience.

          "speaker": "ai",
          "content": "That's completely understandable, Gregory. A lot of people feel that way—especially when they're just starting out. The good news is, you're not alone, and there are practical ways to make those situations feel less overwhelming.\n\nLet's start small. Instead of thinking about networking events or parties as big, scary things, how about we break them down? For example, what if you set a tiny goal for yourself at the next event—like just introducing yourself to one person and asking them one question about themselves? That way, the pressure is off to be \"perfect\" or talk to everyone.\n\nAlso, have you ever tried doing a little prep beforehand? Like thinking of a couple of open-ended questions you could ask (e.g., \"What brought you to this event?\" or \"What are you studying?\")? Sometimes having a \"script\" in your back pocket can ease some of that anxiety.\n\nHow does that sound to you?",

But here's the thing: most people at events like these are just as nervous as you are, or they're genuinely happy to chat. They're probably not judging your questions—they're just glad someone started a conversation!\n\nAnd blanking out is super common when you're anxious. One trick that might help is to prepare a couple of simple, go-to questions ahead of time. You don't need anything fancy—things like:\n\n- \"What are you studying?\"  \n- \"How did you hear about this event?\"  \n- \"What do you think of [the food, the speaker, the campus] so far?\"\n\nThese are low-pressure and give the other person a chance to talk, which takes some of the focus off you. Plus, people generally love talking about themselves!\n\nWould you be open to practicing one of these with me right now, just to get a",

And looking down is totally normal when you’re feeling nervous—no need to apologize.\n\nNow, let’s try building on that. If someone asked you that same question—“What are you studying?”—how would you answer? Maybe something like: “I’m in Engineering, focusing on [your interest, if you have one]. How about you?”\n\nSee how it keeps the conversation flowing? You’re doing better than you think, Gregory. Want to give your answer a try?",

Have you decided on a specialization yet?\"\n\nThat shows curiosity and gives the other person a chance to share, which takes some pressure off you.

First off, I want to acknowledge that it takes courage to step into a coaching session like this, especially when you're not sure where to begin. Let's start by just taking a breath—no pressure here. What's on your mind today? Is there a specific social situation you've been finding challenging, or is it more of a general feeling when you're around others?",

Talking about social skills can feel vulnerable, but you're already doing something brave just by showing up. Let's take this at your pace—there's no pressure.\n\nSince you mentioned you're not sure how to start, maybe we can begin with something simple: what's one small social situation you've encountered recently that felt challenging or made you anxious? Even something like starting a conversation with a classmate or asking a professor a question after class. We can break it down together.\n\nRemember, social skills are like any other skill—they take practice, and it's okay to have off days. You've got this!",

It sounds like you were really putting yourself out there, and that's something to be proud of, even if it didn't go as planned.\n\nWhen your mind goes blank, it's often because of pressure you're putting on yourself to say something \"perfect.\" Let's try shifting that mindset. Instead of aiming for a deep or impressive conversation, start with something simple and low-pressure. For example:\n\n- \"Hey, how did you find that last assignment?\"\n- \"What did you think of the professor's explanation today?\"\n- Even a simple, \"Hi, I'm Gregory. What's your name?\" can work.\n\nWould you be open to practicing a quick role-play with me right now? We can pretend we're in class, and I'll be the other student. No pressure—just to get a feel for it.",

Now you could:\n- Bond over the struggle: \"No, I’m still stuck on it too—want to compare notes sometime?\"\n- Or even suggest studying together: \"Maybe we could work on it together after class?\"\n\nYou’re doing really well.

It doesn’t mean they don’t like you!\n\nHere’s a reframe: instead of seeing it as rejection, think of it as gathering information. If they say no, you could respond lightly: \"No worries! If you change your mind, just let me know.\" That keeps things friendly and low-pressure.\n\nAnd remember—every \"no\" gets you closer to a \"yes.\" The more you ask, the easier it becomes.

For example, something simple like, “Hey, I was wondering if we could go over the assignment together sometime?” You could even practice saying it out loud when you’re alone.

I’m here to help, not judge—so no pressure at all. Let’s start by taking it one step at a time.\n\nSince you mentioned social anxiety and wanting to improve your social skills, can you tell me a bit about a recent situation where you felt uncomfortable or unsure in a social setting? It could be something small—like talking to a classmate, joining a group discussion, or even just introducing yourself. Whatever comes to mind!",

          "content": "Hey, thank you for sharing that—I know it’s not easy to talk about moments like that. First off, please know that freezing up in those situations is way more common than you might think, especially when you’re passionate or nervous about a topic. It doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with you.\n\nLet’s break it down a bit:  \n- What do you think triggered that reaction? Was it fear of not explaining the project well, or maybe worrying about what they’d think of you?  \n- And how did you feel afterward?  \n\nWe can work together on some simple strategies to help you feel more prepared and confident in those moments. You’re not alone in this!",

That fear of being judged can feel overwhelming in the moment, and it’s totally okay to feel that way. But let me reassure you: freezing up doesn’t mean you’re a failure. It just means your brain went into protection mode, and that’s something we can work with.\n\nHere’s a small, practical idea for next time:  \nTry preparing a 1–2 sentence “elevator pitch” about your project. Something simple like, “I’m working on [brief description], and right now I’m focusing on [one specific part].” You can even practice saying it out loud when you’re alone. That way, you’ll have a go-to response that feels familiar and lowers the pressure in the moment.\n\nHow does that sound? And remember—progress, not perfection. You",

          "speaker": "ai",
          "content": "That’s a totally valid concern—shaky voice and nerves are super common, especially when you’re putting yourself out there. But here’s the thing: most people are so wrapped up in their own thoughts, they won’t even notice if your voice wavers a little. And honestly? A bit of nervousness can even make you seem more genuine and passionate.\n\nHere’s a trick: try taking one slow, deep breath before you start speaking. It calms your nervous system and gives you a second to gather your thoughts. You can even say something like, “Let me gather my thoughts for a sec,” which shows self-awareness, not weakness.\n\nWant to try practicing your pitch with me right now? We can keep it low-pressure—just a sentence or two. I’m here to listen, not judge.",

You don’t have to rush—people will wait.\n- It’s okay to pause and breathe mid-sentence. It actually makes you sound more thoughtful.\n\nWant to give it one more try, maybe just the first part? “I’m working on a bridge design project…” You’ve got this.",

First off, I want to say that it takes a lot of courage to reach out and work on something like this—especially when social anxiety is part of the picture. You’re already taking a positive step just by being here. Let’s start slow and make this comfortable for you.\n\nSince you mentioned you’re not sure how to start, let’s begin with something simple: What’s one small social situation you’ve encountered recently that felt challenging or awkward? It could be anything—like talking to a classmate, asking a question in a lecture, or even just saying hi to someone in your dorm.",

          "content": "That’s totally okay, Gregory—moments like that happen to a lot of people, especially when anxiety kicks in. It sounds like your mind might have gone blank in that moment, which is a common reaction when we feel overwhelmed. Let’s break it down together.\n\nFirst, what do you think was going through your mind right before your lab partner approached you? Were you worried about saying the wrong thing, or maybe feeling pressure to respond perfectly?",

That fear of being judged or saying the wrong thing is really common, especially when you’re high in neuroticism like you mentioned. But here’s something important: most people are so focused on themselves that they don’t scrutinize others as much as we fear.\n\nLet’s try a small, practical exercise for next time. Instead of aiming for a full conversation, just focus on one simple thing: making eye contact and giving a small smile or a nod. You don’t even have to say anything at first if it feels like too much. Would you be willing to try that with someone familiar, like your lab partner, and see how it goes?",

          "speaker": "ai",
          "content": "That’s a really valid concern, and it shows you’re thoughtful about how you come across. But here’s the thing: a nod and a smile are actually universally seen as friendly and approachable—they signal “I see you” or “I’m listening,” not rudeness. Most people will interpret it positively, especially if they know you’re a bit quiet.\n\nIf you’re still worried, you could even follow up with something super simple later, like, “Hey, sorry I was in my own head earlier.” It shows self-awareness and can actually make you more relatable.\n\nHow does that sound? Small steps like this can build your confidence over time.",

Honestly, it might feel awkward in the moment, but it’s not nearly as big a deal as it feels. Most people won’t even notice, and if they do, they’ll probably just assume you’re distracted or thinking.\n\nIf it helps, you can even laugh it off lightly—something like, “Whoops, zoned out for a sec!”—which can actually make you seem more human and relatable. The goal isn’t perfection; it’s just showing up and trying. You’ve got this, Gregory. Want to set a mini-goal, like trying this once with your roommate this week?",

Let me reassure you: most people are too focused on themselves to judge, and many feel just as nervous as you do.\n\nHere's a practical idea: try preparing a couple of simple, low-pressure conversation starters.

In fact, most people at networking events are just hoping someone talks to *them*!\n\nHow about trying a simple, low-pressure opener next time? Something like:  \n“Hi, I’m Gregory. I’m studying Engineering—what brings you to this event?”  \nOr even: “These snacks are pretty good, right?”  \n\nIt doesn’t have to be deep—just a way to get the ball rolling.

It's great to meet you, and I want to start by saying it takes real courage to reach out and work on social skills—especially when you're dealing with social anxiety. I'm here to support you, not judge you, so let's take this at your pace.\n\nFirst off, let's acknowledge something: you've already taken a huge step just by showing up today. That's something to be proud of! Social skills are like any other skill—they can be practiced and improved over time. And you're not alone in this; lots of students, even the ones who seem super confident, are working on similar things.\n\nSince you mentioned you're not sure how to start conversations, let's break it down. What's one small situation where you'd like to feel more comfortable socially? Maybe something like starting a chat with a classmate or asking a question in a study group? We can start there and build from the ground up.",

          "speaker": "ai",
          "content": "That's totally understandable, Gregory. It's amazing how something as simple as saying \"hi\" can feel so overwhelming when anxiety kicks in. Let's reframe this: you're not alone—many people feel that initial rush of nerves.\n\nHere's a gentle approach: start with low-pressure interactions. For example, before or after class, try making brief eye contact and giving a small smile. You don't even have to say anything at first! Just getting comfortable with that can build your confidence. When you're ready, you could add a simple, \"Hey, how's it going?\" or comment on something shared, like the class or an assignment.\n\nRemember, most people appreciate a friendly gesture, and brief interactions like these often don't require long conversations. Would you be willing to try just one of these small steps this week and see how it feels?",

          "speaker": "ai",
          "content": "I hear you, and it's completely okay to feel that way—sweaty hands and all! Let me reassure you: a friendly smile is rarely perceived as \"weird.\" In fact, most people interpret it as warmth and approachability. If someone doesn't smile back, it's almost never personal—they might be stressed, distracted, or dealing with their own nerves.\n\nHere's a little reframe that might help: instead of worrying about what they *might* think, focus on what you're offering—a moment of kindness. You're creating a positive ripple, and that's something to feel good about!\n\nAnd hey, if it helps, practice in a mirror or with a trusted friend first. Small steps build big confidence. You've got this, Gregory. How does that sound?",

It takes the pressure off, and you can even let him know you're working on this if that feels comfortable—sometimes sharing our goals helps others cheer us on.\n\nRemember, progress isn't about perfection; it's about trying. Every small effort counts, and you're already moving forward just by planning this. I'm really proud of you for taking these steps. How about we check in after you give it a try?

Starting a conversation about improving social skills can feel intimidating, but you’ve already done the hardest part—reaching out. Let’s take this one step at a time.\n\nFirst, tell me a little about what specific social situations make you feel most anxious. Is it talking to professors, meeting new people in your classes, or something else? Understanding where the discomfort comes from can help us build a plan that feels manageable for you.\n\nRemember, you’re not alone in feeling this way—many students, especially in high-pressure environments like engineering and law, experience social anxiety. We’ll work together on practical strategies that fit your personality and goals.",

The physical reactions—like sweaty hands—are your body’s way of responding to stress, and it’s something a lot of people experience.\n\nLet’s break this down into smaller, manageable steps:\n\n1. **Prepare a Simple Introduction**: Having a go-to introduction can ease some of that initial anxiety. Something like, “Hi, I’m Gregory, an engineering undergrad interested in [mention something specific, like renewable energy or robotics]. What brings you here?” Practice saying it out loud a few times so it feels more natural.\n\n2. **Set Small Goals**: Instead of putting pressure on yourself to talk to everyone, aim for one or two conversations per event. Even just introducing yourself to one person is a win!\n\n3. **Use Questions to Keep Conversations Flowing**: People generally enjoy talking about themselves. Ask open-ended",

          "speaker": "ai",
          "content": "I totally get that fear—it’s natural to worry about how you’re coming across. But here’s the thing: most people at networking events are focused on their own nerves or what *they’re* going to say next. They’re probably not judging you nearly as much as you think.\n\nIf you forget your intro or feel stuck, it’s okay to keep it simple. Something like, “Sorry, I’m a bit nervous—this is my first event like this!” can actually make you seem more relatable and human. People appreciate honesty.\n\nAlso, remember: you don’t have to be perfect. Conversations are meant to be a little messy sometimes. The goal is connection, not perfection. Would you like to practice a short intro together right now? We can make it feel more comfortable before you try it out for real.",

Let’s build on it just a little so you feel more prepared.\n\nHow about adding one more sentence about an interest? For example:  \n“Hi, I’m Gregory—I’m studying engineering, and I’m really interested in sustainable energy.”  \n\nSee how that gives the other person an easy way to respond? They might say, “Oh, cool! What got you into that?” and suddenly you’re having a real conversation.\n\nWant to try it again with that added bit? I’m right here cheering you on.",

If you want, you can even turn that slight nervousness into a strength by smiling and saying something like, “I’m still getting used to these events, but I’m excited to learn more.”\n\nYou’re doing better than you think.

It might help ground you a bit.

The good news is, it’s something we can work on step by step.\n\nOne thing that might help is having a couple of “go-to” questions or topics ready. For engineering events, you could ask things like:\n- “What kind of projects are you working on?”\n- “Have you taken Professor X’s class? What did you think?”\n- “Are you involved in any clubs or research?”\n\nThese are low-pressure and relevant to your interests.

Something like:  \n“Right now, I’m working on [brief project or class topic]. I’m really interested in [specific area, e.g., renewable energy systems or coding], but I’m still exploring what I want to focus on.”\n\nThat way, you’re not scrambling in the moment.

You’re definitely not alone in feeling this way.\n\nHere’s a small idea: next time, try having just one simple goal—like saying “Hi, I’m Gregory” to one person. You don’t even have to follow up with a question right away if it feels like too much. And remember, most people at mixers are also hoping someone talks to *them*—they might be just as nervous as you are.\n\nWould you be open to practicing a short, low-pressure opener with me right now?

If someone does walk away or seem uninterested (which is rare!), it’s almost never personal—they might be shy, in a rush, or just having an off day.\n\nHow about pairing your intro with a light, open-ended question? Something like:  \n“Hi, I’m Gregory. What brought you to this mixer?”  \nIt gives the other person an easy way to respond, and takes a little pressure off you to carry the conversation.\n\nWant to try it out with me?

The good news is, you're not alone in feeling this way, and there are practical steps you can take to feel more comfortable.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Start Small**: Instead of diving into a huge event, maybe begin with smaller, lower-pressure situations. For example, joining a club related to engineering or law could help you practice socializing in a more structured setting with people who share your interests.\n\n2. **Prepare a Few Conversation Starters**: Having a couple of simple, open-ended questions ready can ease the pressure. Things like, \"What brought you to this event?\" or \"What are you studying?\" can help get the ball rolling. You can even practice these with a friend beforehand.\n\n3. **Set Realistic Goals**: Instead of aiming to talk to everyone, maybe set a small goal for yourself, like introducing",

That takes a lot of courage just to show up—many people wouldn't even get that far, so give yourself credit for trying.\n\nThe fear of saying something \"stupid\" is something almost everyone experiences, especially in new social situations. Here’s a reframe that might help: most people are so focused on their own insecurities or what they’re going to say next that they hardly notice small slip-ups. And honestly, making a small mistake humanizes you—it can even make you more relatable.\n\nMaybe next time, you could try bringing a friend along to the club or event, or even just messaging the club ahead of time to ask if you can shadow a meeting quietly at first. That way, you’re not walking in completely alone.\n\nWhat do you think—does that feel manageable, or is there another",

In fact, club leaders and members usually appreciate when someone reaches out beforehand—it helps them prepare to welcome you.\n\nHere’s a little script you could adapt if it helps:\n\n> \"Hi, I'm Gregory, a first-year engineering student. I'm interested in joining the club but am a bit nervous about coming to my first meeting. Would it be okay if I dropped by, maybe just to observe at first?\"\n\nPeople respond really well to honesty like that. It’s relatable, and it gives them a chance to support you. And if someone did think it was \"weird\" (which they almost certainly won’t), that says more about them than you.

Let’s reframe it: group work is actually a great low-pressure way to practice social skills because you already have a shared goal.\n\nHere’s a practical idea: next time you’re assigned a group, try taking one small step. Maybe send a message in the group chat first—something simple like, “Hey everyone, when works for everyone to meet up or chat online?” That puts you in a leadership role without needing to be face-to-face right away.

They’re probably not judging you; they’re relieved someone’s taking initiative!\n\nIf no one replies right away, it’s almost never personal—people get busy, forget, or might be nervous too. You could follow up gently after a day: “Just checking in—any thoughts on timing?” That shows persistence without pressure.\n\nRemember: every small attempt is practice.

That’s creative, practical, and honestly something a lot of people would be interested in.

That’s the kind of genuine excitement people love to hear about.\n\nHow about this: next time you're in a situation where you might share this, you could start small.

When our brains sense pressure, they sometimes hit the “pause” button—it’s a natural stress response, not a reflection of your knowledge or ability.\n\nHere’s a little trick: you don’t have to have all the answers. If someone asks a question and your mind goes blank, it’s okay to say something like, “That’s a good question—let me think for a second,” or even, “I’m still working out some details, but the basic idea was…” That gives you time to breathe and gather your thoughts. People usually appreciate honesty more than perfection.\n\nWant to try a quick practice? I can ask a simple follow-up question, and you can respond however feels comfortable—no right or wrong.",

          "content": "Hi Gregory, it’s really great that you’re reaching out to work on this—that takes courage, and I totally get that it can feel awkward at first. A lot of students feel unsure where to begin with social skills, especially when they're juggling a demanding major like Engineering. It’s completely normal to feel this way, and you’re already taking a positive step just by being here.\n\nLet’s start with something small and manageable. What’s one social situation that’s been on your mind lately—maybe something you’d like to feel more comfortable in?",

        {
          "turn": 4,
          "speaker": "ai",
          "content": "That’s totally understandable, Gregory. Networking events can feel overwhelming, especially when you're dealing with social anxiety. A lot of people—even the ones who seem super confident—get nervous in those situations. It’s okay that your body reacts that way; it’s just trying to protect you, even if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nLet’s break it down into a smaller step. Instead of thinking about talking to a whole room, what if you just focused on saying hi to one person? Maybe even practice a simple opener like, “Hi, I’m Gregory. I’m studying Engineering—what brings you here today?” Would you be open to trying something like that at the next event?",

          "speaker": "ai",
          "content": "It makes total sense that you’re worried about that—rejection is a really common fear, and it’s something almost everyone struggles with at some point. Your brain is just trying to keep you safe, but sometimes it goes into overdrive. The fact that you’re even imagining these scenarios shows how much you care, and that’s actually a strength.\n\nLet’s try reframing it: what if, instead of seeing it as a performance, you approached it as curiosity? You could think, “I’m just here to learn about this person,” rather than “I need to impress them.” And remember—most people at networking events are also a little nervous and hoping someone talks to them! Would it help to practice a couple of lines with me right now, just to get comfortable?",

          "content": "Absolutely, that’s a perfect place to start. “Hi, I’m Gregory” is simple, genuine, and enough to open a door—you don’t need to pressure yourself to say more than you’re ready for. And if your voice shakes, that’s okay too. Most people won’t even notice, and if they do, they’ll probably just think you’re human (because you are!).\n\nWant to try saying it out loud now, just to get the feel of it? There’s no rush, and no judgment here.",

It takes a lot of self-awareness to recognize you want to work on your social skills, especially when you're juggling so much as an engineering student. I'm here to help you break things down step by step.\n\nFirst, I want to understand a little more about what specifically feels challenging for you socially. Is it starting conversations, keeping them going, or maybe something else? And how does your anxiety usually show up in those moments—like racing thoughts, physical tension, or avoiding situations altogether?",

Let’s reframe this: stumbling over your words or asking a “dumb” question doesn’t mean people think you’re incompetent. In fact, most people appreciate someone showing genuine curiosity. \n\nSince your anxiety is high right now, how about we make it even smaller? Instead of a full conversation, just practice saying “Hey, how’s it going?” to one person each day. No follow-up needed. The goal isn’t to have a perfect interaction—it’s to prove to yourself that you can survive the moment, shaky hands and all. What do you think?",

They might be stressed, in a hurry, or just zoning out. Your job is just to deliver the line and notice that you’re okay afterward. No catastrophe.\n\nWant to try it tomorrow and report back?

It's really common for our minds to go blank when we're anxious—it's like our brain is trying to protect us, but it ends up making things harder. The good news is, there are simple strategies we can practice to help you feel more prepared and confident.\n\nFor example, would you be open to trying a few conversation starters or questions you could have in your back pocket for networking events or group projects?

And questions like the ones we talked about are actually really thoughtful—they show you're interested in the other person, which people appreciate.\n\nHow about we practice right now?

It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge you want to work on something, especially when it comes to social skills—so first off, I want you to know that’s a really strong first step. A lot of people feel unsure or anxious in social situations, especially in college where there’s so much going on. You’re definitely not alone in this.\n\nLet’s start slow. What’s one small social situation that’s been on your mind lately—maybe something you’ve been avoiding or feeling nervous about?",

          "content": "I totally get that—group projects can feel intense, especially when you're worried about saying the right thing or being judged. It's completely normal to feel that way, and honestly, a lot of people (even the ones who seem super confident) struggle with that too. You're putting in effort just by showing up and trying, and that's something to be proud of.\n\nLet’s break it down a bit: What do you think triggers that \"mind going blank\" feeling the most? Is it when you're put on the spot, or is it more about not knowing what to say?",

It’s okay not to know everything, and honestly, admitting that can actually make you seem more genuine and approachable.\n\nHere’s a small, practical idea: next time someone asks you something and you’re not sure, try saying something like, “That’s a good question—let me think about it for a sec,” or even, “I’m not totally sure, what do you think?” It gives you a moment to breathe and shifts the pressure a bit.

Lots of people, especially in high-pressure environments like engineering, worry about looking like they don’t know enough.\n\nBut here’s something to consider: staying quiet might feel safer in the moment, but it can actually make you feel more isolated over time. What if we practiced just one small response, like, “I’m not sure, but I’ll look into it,” in a low-stakes setting first? Maybe even say it out loud when you’re alone, just to get comfortable with the words. How does that sound?",

A lot of students feel that way, so you're definitely not alone. Social skills are something we can all continue to grow in, no matter where we're starting from.\n\nBefore we dive in, can you tell me a little more about what specific social situations feel most challenging for you right now?

And it's really common for deep breathing alone to not feel like enough when anxiety is really intense.\n\nSince you mentioned your mind goes blank, let's try pairing a quick physical grounding technique with a simple social script. How does this sound: When you feel yourself starting to freeze, press your feet firmly into the floor and take one slow breath—just one, really intentional. Then pick one of these easy phrases to use, like:\n\n- \"What brought you here tonight?\" (for parties)\n- \"How do you think we should break up the work?\" (for group projects)\n\nWould you be willing to try that combo this week, even just once, and see how it feels?",

          "content": "Gregory, I totally get that fear—it’s your brain trying to protect you from perceived risk, and that’s normal. But here’s something important: most people are so focused on themselves, they aren’t judging your questions nearly as harshly as you might fear.\n\nLet’s try this: before you even say anything, unclench your fists (gentle reminder—you’re doing it now, and that’s okay!) and shake your hands out for just a second. It releases tension and sends a signal to your brain that you’re safe. Then use your feet grounding + one breath, and remember—questions like the ones we practiced are actually really common and welcoming. Most people appreciate someone making an effort to include them.\n\nWhat’s the smallest step you feel you could take—maybe practicing the script in the mirror, or trying it with just one person first?",

And about stuttering: it happens to almost everyone when they’re nervous, and most people don’t even blink—they’re just happy someone’s talking to them!\n\nHere’s a little trick: if you feel yourself about to stutter, pause, smile softly (even if forced—it relaxes your facial muscles), and just say the word slowly. It actually makes you look thoughtful, not nervous. Want to try that in the mirror with me right now? We can role-play for 30 seconds—no pressure at all.",

Let’s try something: next time, take a breath before you start and say it like you’re telling a friend, not performing. And if your voice cracks? Own it lightly: “Whoops, guess my voice is excited to meet you!” Humor can ease tension—yours and theirs.\n\nWant to try one more time, just us, no judgment? We can make it silly on purpose—sometimes taking the pressure off helps more than trying to be “perfect.”",

It takes real courage to acknowledge you want to work on your social skills, especially when you're dealing with high social anxiety—I know that feeling of not knowing how to start can be overwhelming. Let’s start by unpacking what’s happening for you.\n\nWhen you say you’re “not really sure how to start,” I’m hearing that you might feel uncertain or even a little self-conscious in social situations, maybe worrying about saying the “wrong” thing or being judged. Does that resonate?\n\nSince you’re highly extroverted but also high in neuroticism, you probably crave connection but get held back by overthinking or fear of rejection—especially in high-stakes situations like networking or talking to professors about research opportunities. Am I on the right track?\n\nLet’s co-create a small, practical step today. Given your goals around landing a research position and publishing, how would you feel about practicing a low-pressure conversation",

That \"freeze\" response is your brain's way of trying to protect you from perceived threat—in this case, the possibility of judgment or embarrassment. It's especially common when talking to authority figures like professors, where the stakes feel higher.\n\nGiven your extroverted nature, you likely thrive on connection once you get past that initial hurdle. Let's work with that strength.\n\nHere's a micro-step you could try this week:  \nIdentify one professor whose work genuinely interests you and prepare just one specific question about their research—something like \"I read your paper on X and was curious how you approached Y.\" Practice saying it aloud once or twice beforehand. You're not trying to impress; you're just practicing curiosity. How does that feel?",

          "content": "Gregory, I want you to hear this: *Every single student* worries about sounding \"dumb\" in front of professors—it's practically a universal experience. Your fear isn't unusual; it's human.\n\nHere’s what’s true: Professors *love* when students show genuine interest in their work. They remember what it was like to be in your shoes. A stumbled word or moment of nerves won’t register to them the way it does to you—they’ll just be glad you asked.\n\nLet’s normalize the stumble. It’s okay to say, “Sorry, I’m a bit nervous—I really admire your work.” That kind of authenticity can actually make you more relatable.\n\nWant to try roleplaying it right now? I can be the professor, and you can practice your question. We can make it as awkward as needed—no judgment here.",

Would you have a moment to talk about how you approached that research?”\n\nSee how the specific detail shows you’ve done your homework? It gives you an anchor if nerves spike.

Messing up a term? It signals you’re learning, not failing. In fact, asking for clarification (“Sorry, could you remind me what X means?”) makes you look engaged, not incompetent.\n\nTry this script if your mind goes blank:  \n“I’m still new to this field, so I might not have the terminology right, but I was really fascinated by how you…”\n\nWant to practice that recovery line until it feels like a safety net?",

I’m here to help, and we’ll take this step by step—no pressure at all.\n\nFirst, let’s start with something small and manageable. Since you mentioned you’re extroverted and agreeable, you probably enjoy connecting with people once you get past the initial nerves. Here’s a simple micro-strategy to try:\n\n**Actionable Step:**  \nNext time you’re in a common area—like the student lounge, library, or even waiting in line at the café—make eye contact with one person and give a genuine, warm smile. You don’t have to say anything unless it feels natural. This low-pressure action can help ease you into social interactions without the stress of a full conversation right away.\n\nHow does that sound to you? Would you be willing to try it this week",

          "speaker": "ai",
          "content": "That’s a totally valid concern, Gregory—and honestly, a lot of people worry about that exact thing. It’s completely normal to feel that way, especially when you’re putting yourself out there. Let’s break this down a bit.\n\nFirst, remember that you’re an agreeable and extroverted person—people likely find you warm and approachable even if you don’t realize it. A smile from someone like you can actually make someone’s day better, even if they don’t show it right away.\n\nHere’s a reframe that might help:  \nThink of smiling not as something that requires a specific reaction, but as a small gift you’re offering. You’re controlling your action, not their response. If they don’t smile back, it probably has nothing to do with you—they might be stressed, distracted, or just having an off moment.\n\n**Micro-strategy to ease anxiety:**  \nSet a tiny, private",

          "content": "That’s completely understandable, Gregory—social anxiety can feel really physical, and it’s okay to acknowledge that. The fact that you’re willing to try even when it feels uncomfortable shows a lot of strength.\n\nSince you’re someone who’s extroverted and enjoys connecting with people, let’s channel that energy into something that feels a little more in your control. When you feel those physical signs of anxiety (sweating, shaking), it’s your body’s way of trying to protect you—it just needs a gentle redirect.\n\n**Micro-strategy to manage physical anxiety in the moment:**  \nRight before you smile, take one slow, quiet breath in through your nose (count to 4), hold for 2, and exhale slowly through your mouth (count to 6). You can do this subtly—no one will notice. This isn’t about stopping the anxiety, just calming your nervous system enough so you feel a bit more grounded",

The goal isn’t perfection; it’s just giving your body a gentle signal to slow down. Even a slightly uneven breath can help.\n\nAnd if someone does notice (which is unlikely—people are usually focused on themselves!), you can always play it off casually. Maybe you’re just taking a thoughtful pause or sighing softly. No big deal.\n\nHere’s an even simpler version if counting feels like too much pressure:\n\n**Alternative micro-strategy:**  \nBefore you smile, just silently say to yourself: “In… and out.” Breathe in as you think “in,” breathe out as you think “out.” That’s it. No numbers, no rules. You’re guiding your breath, not performing.\n\nYou’ve got this, Gregory. Small steps",

Voice cracks happen to almost everyone when they’re nervous; it’s just your vocal cords tightening up from adrenaline. The good news? It’s usually way more noticeable to you than to others.\n\nSince you’re extroverted and people-oriented, you can use your natural warmth to put both yourself and others at ease, even if your voice isn’t perfectly steady.\n\n**Micro-strategy if your voice feels shaky:**  \nKeep a small bottle of water with you. If you feel your throat tightening, take a casual sip—it gives you a moment to pause, hydrate your vocal cords, and reset. Plus, it looks completely natural. No one will think twice about it.\n\nYou’re doing great just by trying. Progress over perfection, always.",

When you feel your mind start to blank, you can use a simple follow-up question to keep the conversation flowing, like:  \n“What brought you into engineering?” or even, “Have you worked on any interesting projects lately?”\n\nThese are light, open-ended, and shift the focus to the other person—which takes pressure off you.

I’m here to help, not judge.\n\nBefore we jump into strategies, can you tell me a little more about what *specifically* makes social situations feel difficult for you? For example, is it the fear of saying the wrong thing, feeling like you don’t belong, or maybe worrying about how others perceive you? The more specific you can be, the better we can tailor an approach that works for *you*.",

It sounds like your main emotional barrier is **fear of judgment**, especially around saying the \"wrong\" thing or not measuring up.\n\nSince you mentioned you’re highly extroverted (meaning you probably *want* to connect with people) but also high in neuroticism (so your inner critic is loud), let’s co-create a plan that’s low-pressure and builds momentum gradually. How does this sound?\n\nWe can start with **micro-interactions**—tiny, scripted social \"wins\" that help rewire your brain to see socializing as safe, not scary. For example:\n\n1. **Compliment + Exit**: Pick one person per day (a classmate, barista, etc.) and give a genuine, simple compliment—\"I like your laptop sticker\" or \"Great presentation today\"—",

But even if someone reacts neutrally or seems caught off guard, it’s rarely personal—they might just be distracted or having an off day.\n\nSince your anxiety is high around this, let’s make it even simpler:\n\n- Start with people in \"low-stakes\" roles, like cafeteria staff or librarians—they’re used to brief, friendly interactions.\n- Keep the compliment specific and genuine but *very short*—then immediately excuse yourself (\"Anyway, have a great day!\") so you don’t overthink it.\n\nThe goal isn’t a long conversation yet—it’s just practicing *initiating*. Each time you do this, you’re gathering evidence that the world doesn’t end when you speak up.\n\nWant to try role-playing one quick exchange right now?",

That’ll help your voice carry naturally, too.\n\nWant to try it once more, just focusing on that chin-up moment? You’re doing great.

I want you to know that it’s completely normal to feel unsure or even a little anxious about improving social skills, especially in a new environment like college. You’re definitely not alone in this.\n\nLet’s start small. What’s one social situation lately that felt particularly challenging or made you feel anxious?",

          "content": "That sounds really tough, Gregory. I want you to know that it’s totally okay to feel that way—mixers can be overwhelming for a lot of people, even those who seem outgoing. The fact that you went at all is a huge step, and standing by the snacks is a classic move—I’ve done it too! It’s a safe space, and there’s no shame in starting there.\n\nWhen your hands were shaking, that’s your body’s way of responding to stress, and it’s completely normal. Next time, maybe try taking a few deep breaths before you even walk in, or set a tiny goal for yourself—like just saying “hi” to one person near the snack table. You don’t have to have a full conversation right away. Small steps build confidence. How does that sound?",

          "speaker": "ai",
          "content": "I totally get that—it’s scary to put yourself out there, and the fear of rejection is real. But here’s the thing: most people at mixers are also hoping someone will talk to them, even if they don’t show it. And if someone does ignore you or seem uninterested, it’s almost never personal—they might be having an off day, or be just as nervous as you are.\n\nWhat if you tried a simple, low-pressure opener, like, “Hey, have you tried these snacks? Any good?” It’s casual, relatable, and gives you an easy way to step back if you need to. You’re not committing to a long chat—just testing the waters. And honestly, if someone reacts poorly, that says more about them than you. You’re brave just for trying. Want to give it a shot next time?",

          "content": "That’s a totally valid worry, and honestly, it happens to everyone—even people who seem super confident. If your voice cracks or you stutter, it’s okay! Most people won’t even notice, and if they do, they’ll probably just think you’re human (because you are!). You could even laugh it off lightly—something like, “Wow, words are hard today!”—which can actually make you seem more relatable and ease the tension.\n\nRemember, perfection isn’t the goal here; connection is. And small, genuine moments—even a little awkward—often mean more than flawless small talk. You’ve got this, Gregory. Want to practice that snack line with me right now, just to get comfortable with it?",

It doesn’t sound “terrible”—it sounds human. I promise you, in a real conversation, people are focusing more on what you’re saying than how your voice sounds in that moment.\n\nWhat if we reframe it? Instead of seeing it as a mistake, see it as something that makes the interaction real. If you laugh it off—even just a small smile—it shows you don’t take yourself too seriously, and that can actually put others at ease too.\n\nYou *can* do this. It might not feel smooth every time, and that’s okay. Progress over perfection, always. Want to try one more time, maybe with a deep breath first?",

It sounds like you're carrying some pressure around wanting to connect with others but maybe worrying about how you'll come across or if you'll say the \"right\" thing. Am I on track?\n\nLet's start small. For this week, try this:  \n**Micro-action:** Make eye contact and give a small, genuine smile to one person each day—maybe a classmate or someone in the dining hall. You don’t even have to say anything.  \n**Reframe:** Instead of thinking, \"What if they think I'm weird?\", tell yourself, \"This is a simple, human moment. Most people appreciate a friendly gesture.\"  \n\nHow does that feel for a first step?",

          "content": "I totally get that—it feels vulnerable to put yourself out there, especially when rejection or awkwardness feels like a real possibility. That fear of being ignored or judged is completely valid, and it’s something a lot of people struggle with, even if they don’t show it.\n\nLet’s adjust:  \n**Micro-action:** Instead of aiming for a full smile, try just softening your expression for a second when you pass someone in the hallway. No pressure to hold it—just a quick, neutral-but-friendly look.  \n**Reframe:** Remind yourself, “This isn’t about their reaction; it’s about me practicing feeling calm in small social moments.”  \n\nWould that feel more manageable?",

Most people are wrapped up in their own thoughts and barely notice brief, neutral expressions. You’re likely not even on their radar in that moment.\n\n**Micro-action:** Pair that softened look with taking one slow, deep breath right after. Keep it physical—focus on the feeling of your feet on the ground.  \n**Reframe:** Shift from “They’ll think I’m weird” to “I’m practicing feeling grounded, not controlling their perception.”  \n\nYou’ve got this. Want to check in after you try it a couple times?",

I want you to know it’s completely okay to feel unsure or even a little anxious right now—this is a safe space, and we’ll take it one step at a time.\n\nLet’s start by just taking a breath together. Inhale slowly for four counts… hold for two… and exhale for six. Nice. How does that feel?\n\nNow, tell me a little more: when you think about working on your social skills, what’s one small situation where you’d love to feel a bit more comfortable or confident?",

Lots of people feel that exact same rush of nerves in line at a café. Let’s breathe together again—in for four, hold, out for six. Good.\n\nYou already did something brave just by naming that moment. That’s a strength right there—self-awareness. \n\nNow, let’s break this down into a tiny step. Next time you go for coffee, try this: before you even get in line, pick one thing you’re going to order—something simple, like “medium latte.” Just one phrase. You can even whisper it to yourself while you wait. How does that sound as a starting place?",

The person taking your order has probably heard shaky voices before. They’re human too.\n\nHere’s a reframe: instead of worrying about how you sound, focus on the fact that you showed up. You got in line. You decided what to order. That’s already a win.\n\nAnd if they don’t hear you? That’s not a reflection on you—it happens to everyone. You can just take a breath and repeat yourself calmly. No big deal. You’ve got this. Want to try saying “medium latte” out loud right now, just to practice in a zero-pressure way?",

That was a solid first try.\n\nLet’s try it one more time, but this time, imagine you’re talking to a friend. You don’t have to shout—just pretend you’re telling me what you’d like. Ready? “Hey, I’ll have a medium latte.” You can even smile a little if it feels right—it relaxes your voice. Want to give that a shot?",

Smiling is like a social cue that says, “Hey, we’re both just humans here.”\n\nAnd that awkward feeling? Totally normal. New things feel weird until they become familiar. You’re building a new habit—and you’re doing great.\n\nNext time you’re in line, try this: right before it’s your turn, take one deep breath and remind yourself, “It’s just a coffee order. I’ve got this.” You’re practicing bravery, and that’s something to be proud of. How does that sound?",

It’s totally okay to feel unsure how to start—that’s what we’re here for! I’m here to help you build skills that feel authentic and manageable for you.\n\nGiven what you’ve shared, it sounds like you’re someone who’s outgoing and friendly (high extraversion and agreeableness), but also someone who feels things deeply and might get caught up in worries or overthinking (high neuroticism). That combination can make social situations feel both exciting and overwhelming at the same time, especially when there’s pressure involved—like networking or campus politics.\n\nLet’s start small and focus on what feels doable right now. Here’s a simple, low-pressure action you can try today or this week:\n\n**Micro-Strategy: The 2-Minute Conversation Starter**",

Your mind might be trying to protect you from saying the \"wrong\" thing, but that just makes it harder to start. The good news is, your natural friendliness (that agreeableness!) is a huge asset here—people are likely to respond positively when you reach out, even in small ways.\n\nThe \"2-Minute Conversation Starter\" is just about keeping it brief and low-pressure. You don't need to have a long, deep talk—just a simple, genuine interaction. Here’s how it works:\n\n1. **Pick one person you see regularly** (e.g., someone in your engineering class, in the dining hall, or even a professor after lecture).\n2. **Prepare one open-ended question** ahead of time—something easy like, \"What did you think of that last problem set?\" or \"Have you been to any good",

Your anxiety is trying to protect you, but let’s reframe this: you’re not asking her to solve a rocket equation; you’re just making a friendly, relatable comment about a shared experience (thermo class!). People usually appreciate when someone breaks the ice—it makes things less awkward for everyone.\n\nHere’s a tiny adjustment to make it feel even safer:  \n**Add a \"buffer phrase\"** to your question. Something like:  \n“Hey, I’m Gregory—this might be a random question, but what did you think of the homework problem on entropy?”  \n\nThis does two things:  \n1. It acknowledges the slight awkwardness (which actually makes you seem more human and relatable).  \n2. It gives you an easy exit—if she’s busy or not chatty, you can just say “No worries, see you in class!” and it’s no",

People respond to authenticity more than \"perfection.\" Your agreeableness means you probably put others at ease naturally, even if you don’t feel calm yourself.\n\n**Here’s a micro-strategy for the voice shake:**  \nRight before you speak, take one quiet but deep breath—just enough to steady your diaphragm. You don’t need to make it obvious; just breathe in through your nose for 3 seconds, out through your mouth for 3 seconds. It signals your nervous system: \"Hey, we’re okay.\"\n\nAnd remember: you’re not performing. You’re just sharing a question. If your voice wobbles? Own it lightly—maybe even grin and say, \"Wow, my voice is not cooperating today!\" That kind of vulnerability can actually make the interaction more memorable in a good way.",

The goal isn’t to execute it flawlessly, but to give your body a momentary anchor so you don’t feel swept away by the anxiety.\n\n**Try this even simpler version:**  \nAs you walk toward her, just whisper to yourself, “In… and out.” You don’t need to count—just feel the rhythm. Your body knows how to breathe; you’ve been doing it your whole life! This isn’t about control, it’s about *noticing* your breath for two seconds.\n\nAnd if all else fails? **Smile right before you speak.** A small smile relaxes your vocal cords and tricks your brain into feeling a little more confident—plus, it makes you seem approachable (which you naturally are!).

I hear you.\n\nFirst off, I want to name what might be going on: it sounds like you’re dealing with some social anxiety, maybe even a fear of being judged or not knowing what to say in new situations. That is completely normal, especially in a high-pressure environment like college where everyone seems to have it together (spoiler: they don’t). A lot of people—even the ones who seem super confident—struggle with this, so you’re definitely not alone.\n\nSince you mentioned you’re extraverted but also experience high social anxiety, I’m thinking we can use that outgoing energy you have—just channel it in a more structured way so it feels less overwhelming. How does that sound?\n\nLet’s start small and practical. Since one of your goals is to get a research position",

It’s super common, especially when something matters a lot to you, like landing a research role.\n\nSince you’re extraverted, you probably recharge around people, even if it feels scary at first. Let’s use that to your advantage. I want you to try something I call “micro-networking.” It’s low-pressure and designed to help you warm up socially without the big scary stakes.\n\nHere’s the plan:  \nThis week, pick one professor or grad student whose work interests you—maybe someone in your department doing research you admire. Your only goal is to send one short, friendly email saying you enjoyed their recent lecture/paper and asking if they have 10 minutes for a quick chat sometime. No big asks, just expressing interest.\n\nYou’re not pitching yourself yet; you’re just practicing starting a conversation",

It’s your brain trying to protect you, but it’s also holding you back from opportunities.\n\nHere’s a reframe: Professors *expect* and *appreciate* emails from curious students. They’ve been where you are. In fact, many of them wish *more* students showed interest!\n\nTo ease the rewriting spiral, let’s make this even simpler. Use this template—it’s casual, respectful, and hard to mess up:\n\n*Subject: Question about your [lecture/paper on X]*  \n*Hi Professor [Last Name],*  \n*I really enjoyed your [specific lecture/topic] and it got me thinking about [one brief, genuine takeaway].

It’s not just you; it’s human nature to want to avoid potential discomfort.\n\nBut here’s the reality: Professors get tons of emails. If they don’t respond, it’s almost never personal—they’re busy, they missed it, or they intend to reply later and forget. And if they say no? It’s usually because of timing, not you.\n\nAnd about seeing them afterward—they won’t remember every email. Seriously. You can just smile and say “hi” like normal. No awkwardness required.\n\nWant to make it even lower stakes? Pick a professor you don’t have class with this semester. That way, you remove the “what if I see them” worry entirely.

And choosing Professor Chen is smart; it removes that layer of potential awkwardness.\n\nOne last tip: After you hit send, do something immediately rewarding—watch an episode of something, grab a snack, text a friend. It reinforces that taking social risks doesn’t have to be a big deal.\n\nYou’ve got this. And remember—no matter how it turns out, you’re practicing courage, and that’s what matters most.

A lot of people admire someone who’s genuine, even if they’re a bit unsure.\n\nSince engineering feels easier for you, maybe we can use that as a bridge.

People generally love sharing what they care about, and it shows you’re genuinely interested.\n\nIf you’re still nervous, you could even start by saying something like, “I’m really into engineering projects—what are you working on right now?” That way, you’re giving them a clue about you, too.

It's great to meet you, and I want to start by saying that it takes real courage to reach out for support with social skills—especially when you're feeling unsure how to begin. That tells me you're already taking a step toward growth, and I respect that a lot.\n\nFrom what you've shared, it sounds like your high social anxiety might be making it feel overwhelming to even start conversations or put yourself out there socially. That's completely understandable, especially when you're navigating a demanding environment like engineering and law school. The pressure to perform and connect can feel intense.\n\nLet's start by building on what you're already doing well: you're proactive, you're self-aware, and you're reaching out—that's huge! Since you're naturally extroverted and agreeable, you likely have a genuine warmth that people respond to, even if anxiety sometimes holds you back.\n\nHere’s a small, practical step we can co-create together—one that aligns with your goals",

          "speaker": "ai",
          "content": "I hear you, Gregory—that \"mind going blank\" feeling is incredibly common, especially when anxiety kicks in. It's not a reflection of your social ability at all; it's just your nervous system trying to protect you. The fact that you recognize it shows self-awareness, which is a strength.\n\nSince you're extroverted and agreeable, you probably thrive on connection once you get past that initial hurdle. Let's try a tiny, low-pressure practice: before your next class or study session, pick one person and simply say, \"Hey, how's your day going?\" You don't need a follow-up—just that one question. How does that sound?",

But here's the thing: most people are so wrapped up in their own thoughts, they won't even notice if it feels awkward to you. And if they don't answer? That says more about their mood than about you.\n\nSince you're an engineering student, think of this like an experiment: you're just testing one variable (\"one question\") and observing the outcome. No failure—only data.\n\nWant to try role-playing it with me right now? I'll be the person you're approaching. You just say the line. No pressure—we're on your side here.",

And looking down afterward? That’s okay—it’s a natural reaction. The important part is you took the step.\n\nNow, let’s build on that. Next time, after you ask, try holding eye contact for just one extra second. You don’t even need to say anything else. Your agreeableness makes people feel at ease—trust that. How does practicing that micro-step feel?",

First off, I want to say thank you for reaching out—it takes a lot of courage to admit you want to work on something, especially when it comes to social skills. I totally get that it can feel awkward or vulnerable to start a conversation like this, and that’s completely normal. A lot of students, even the ones who seem super confident, struggle with this stuff too.\n\nIt sounds like you're juggling a lot—engineering, campus life, thinking about your future—and it makes total sense that social situations might feel overwhelming at times.

That feeling of freezing up—like your mind just goes blank—is something so many people experience, especially in high-pressure situations like networking events. It’s completely okay to feel that way, and it doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with you. It’s your brain trying to protect you, even if it feels unhelpful in the moment.\n\nLet’s take a breath together. No need to rush. When you think about those events, what’s the biggest worry that comes up for you? Is it the fear of saying the wrong thing, or maybe feeling like you don’t belong?",

It makes total sense—that fear of sounding \"stupid\" or not measuring up is something almost everyone feels, even the people who look like they have it all together. I promise you, you’re not alone in this.\n\nWhat if we started with something super small, just to dip your toes in? Something that feels almost too easy, so there’s no pressure to perform. For example, maybe your first goal could be just going to an event and saying one thing to one person—even if it’s just, \"Hi, I’m Gregory. What brought you here today?\" How does that sound?",

But here’s the thing: most people at these events are also a little nervous and hoping someone will talk to them. And if someone doesn’t respond, it’s almost never personal—they might be distracted, shy, or having an off day.\n\nHow about we make it even smaller? What if your only goal was to just stand near a small group and listen for a minute or two? No pressure to say anything. You could even plan an exit strategy, like “I’ve got to run to another session” after a short time. Would that feel a little more doable?",

And if they do, it’s usually a positive thing—it shows you’re engaged.\n\nWhat if you gave yourself a role? Like, you’re there to observe and learn, almost like a researcher.

It takes a lot of courage to admit you want to work on your social skills, especially when you're dealing with high social anxiety—I really respect that. It sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed by the idea of networking and putting yourself out there, especially when it comes to connecting with professionals or finding opportunities like research positions. Am I on the right track?\n\nLet's start by breaking this down together. Since you mentioned you're extroverted but also experience high anxiety, I'm thinking we can lean into your natural energy for social situations while building some tools to manage the nerves.

It’s like your mind goes blank just when you want it to perform, right?\n\nLet’s start small and practical. Since you’re extroverted, you probably recharge around people, so we can use that to your advantage. How about we try a low-stakes exercise first? For example, could you commit to saying just *one thing*—a compliment or a simple question—to someone in your engineering classes this week? No pressure to keep the conversation going—just one sentence. What do you think?",

However, the conversation could have more deeply explored his core insecurity of being perceived as \"weird\" or a \"creep\" beyond surface-level reassurance.

It’s completely normal to feel unsure or even a little awkward at first, especially when you're putting yourself out there to grow. I’m here to help, and we can take this at whatever pace feels comfortable for you.\n\nLet’s start simple: what’s one small social situation you’ve been in recently that felt challenging or made you anxious?",

Your body was just trying to protect you, even if it felt overwhelming in the moment. That’s a normal stress response, and it doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with you.\n\nLet’s try something quick together: take a slow breath in through your nose for four seconds, hold it for two, then breathe out through your mouth for six.

The shaking and avoiding eye contact are just your body’s way of saying, “This feels overwhelming.”\n\nLet’s try pairing that breath with something really simple and low-pressure. Next time you’re at an event, try this:  \n- Take one slow breath in through your nose and out through your mouth (just one—no pressure to do a whole sequence).  \n- Then, pick *one person* who also looks a little unsure or is standing alone.  \n- Walk over and use this script: “Hi, I’m Gregory. Engineering and law—weird combo, right?” (It’s okay if your voice shakes; most people won’t even notice.)  \n\nYou don’t have to maintain eye contact the whole time—glance at their shoulder or chin if that feels easier.

It’s not irrational; it’s protective.\n\nBut here’s something to hold onto: most people at networking events are just as nervous as you are. They’re probably worried *you’ll* think *they’re* weird!  \n\nLet’s make this even smaller. You don’t have to approach a group—just one person standing alone. And if they do walk away? It says nothing about you. Maybe they’re in a rush, or shy themselves.  \n\nTry this: right now, take that one slow breath we talked about. Then, imagine saying your line to someone who actually smiles back. How does that feel—even just a little?",

You’re still brave for trying.  \n\nLet’s give you an exit strategy too, so you feel more in control. If someone seems uninterested, you can gracefully wrap it up with:  \n“Well, it was nice meeting you! I’ll let you get back to it.”  \n\nThen you can return to your corner, take another breath, and celebrate—because you did the thing even though it was hard.  \n\nWant to practice saying that exit line with me now?

And you know what? You’re already doing something brave just by being here and sharing that with me.\n\nLet’s pause for a moment. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable, take another slow breath with me—in through your nose, out through your mouth. Good. Remember, there’s no judgment here. You’re in a safe space.\n\nWhat’s one small thing that’s making you feel nervous right now? Is it the idea of talking to people in general, or something more specific?",

That fear is human, and it doesn’t make you weird at all. In fact, it shows how much you care about connecting with others, and that’s a strength.\n\nLet’s try something together: open your eyes when you’re ready, and just notice your feet on the ground or the chair beneath you. You’re here, you’re safe, and you’re doing great.\n\nWhen you say “mess up,” what does that look like in your mind? Sometimes naming the fear can make it feel a little smaller.",

Awkward silences, voice cracks, worrying about saying the “wrong” thing—I’ve been there too, and honestly, most people have. It doesn’t mean you’re failing; it means you’re human.\n\nLet’s try reframing this together: What if, instead of seeing silence as awkward, you saw it as a natural pause—a chance to breathe and collect your thoughts? And what if a voice crack just showed you’re real, not a robot? People tend to relate more to authenticity than perfection.\n\nWould you be open to trying a tiny practice exercise with me?

In fact, if you say something awkward, they’re more likely to relate than to judge. We’ve all been there!\n\nWhat if, instead of trying to be perfect, you gave yourself permission to be human?

It’s not a flaw; it’s a survival mechanism kicking in.\n\nWhat if, instead of fighting it, you acknowledged it? You could even say something simple like, “Wow, my mind just went blank for a sec!” Saying it out loud does two things: it breaks the tension and makes you seem relatable, not panicked. People respect vulnerability—it actually builds connection.\n\nHave you ever tried grounding techniques in those moments?

I get the sense that you might be worried about being judged or not knowing what to say—maybe even a little afraid that people will notice if you’re nervous. Am I on the right track?\n\nFirst off, let me just say: it’s completely okay to feel this way. A lot of people—even the ones who seem super confident—struggle with social anxiety, especially in new or high-stakes situations like networking or talking to professors. Your fears are valid, but they don’t define you, and they definitely don’t have to hold you back.\n\nLet’s start by breaking this down together. What specific social situations feel most challenging to you right now? Is it approaching someone at an event, speaking up in class, or maybe something else?",

          "speaker": "ai",
          "content": "I hear you, Gregory. That freezing feeling—like your mind just goes blank—is something a lot of people experience, especially when they feel pressure to perform or impress. It’s your brain’s way of trying to protect you, but it ends up making things harder. And I want you to know: it’s not “really bad.” It’s human, and it’s something we can work on step by step.\n\nLet’s reframe this a bit. You don’t have to be the smoothest talker in the room. In fact, most people appreciate sincerity and curiosity more than polished small talk. What if, instead of worrying about saying the “right” thing, you focused on just listening and asking one or two simple questions? That takes the pressure off you to perform and lets the other person lead a bit.\n\nWould you be open to trying a small, low-pressure exercise before your next networking event?",

Good.\n\nFirst, let’s acknowledge that fear of “messing up.” It’s completely normal to feel that way, but here’s the thing: there’s no such thing as a perfect interaction. Everyone has moments where they stumble over words or forget what they were going to say. It doesn’t mean you failed—it means you’re human, just like everyone else in that room.\n\nNow, for the exercise: I want you to practice with just one person. Not a room full of professionals—just one. Maybe a classmate, a professor during office hours, or even a barista. Your only goal is to ask one open-ended question and listen to the answer. Something like, “What got you interested in engineering?” or “What’s a project you’re excited about right now?”\n\nYou’re not trying to impress. You’re just",

Really. People notice sincerity far more than a perfectly smooth delivery. And if someone judges you for being a little nervous? That says more about them than it does about you. Most people are so wrapped up in their own thoughts—what *they’re* going to say, how *they’re* coming across—that they won’t even notice if you’re a bit shaky.\n\nYou’re not weird for feeling this way. You’re thoughtful, you care, and that’s actually a strength. People respond to authenticity.\n\nHow about this: let’s role-play it right now. I’ll be the person you’re talking to.

Next time, try holding eye contact for just a second after you ask. It shows you’re genuinely interested.\n\nWant to try one more time, this time without the “sorry”?

Your body is literally trying to protect you, even if it doesn’t feel helpful in the moment.\n\nHere’s something to try: instead of putting pressure on yourself to have a full conversation, what if you just aimed for one genuine comment or question?

I can tell you’re someone who really cares about making meaningful connections—that’s a strength, even if it feels like a source of anxiety right now.\n\nLet’s start by just talking about what’s going through your mind when you’re in social situations. Are there specific moments—like meeting new people, speaking up in class, or even just casual conversations—that feel especially tough?",

It sounds like you’re putting a lot of pressure on yourself to be “perfect” in conversations, and the fear of saying the wrong thing ends up making it harder to say anything at all.

In fact, a lot of people—even the ones who seem super confident—have felt this way at some point.\n\nLet’s reframe this: instead of seeing it as “saying something stupid,” what if you saw conversations as just… sharing little pieces of who you are? You don’t have to be brilliant or impressive. You’re just connecting. People are generally a lot more focused on how *they’re* coming across than judging you.\n\nWould you be open to trying a small, low-pressure exercise to ease into this?",

It could be as simple as, “I like your laptop sticker,” or “That was a really good point in class.” No follow-up conversation needed unless it feels natural.\n\nThe idea is to get comfortable initiating small, positive interactions without the pressure to keep a conversation going.

It takes a lot of self-awareness and courage to even start a conversation like this, especially when you're feeling unsure. I want you to know that what you're feeling is completely normal, especially in a high-pressure environment like college. A lot of students—even the ones who seem super confident—struggle with social situations at times.\n\nLet's start by just acknowledging what you might be feeling right now. Are you noticing any physical sensations—maybe your heart beating a little faster, your palms feeling a bit clammy? That's actually your body's way of preparing you to engage—it's energy, not something to fight. It means you care, and that's a strength. How does that land with you?",

          "content": "First off, please don't apologize—your feelings are completely valid, and it's okay to be nervous. In fact, that racing heart and those trembling hands? That's your body getting ready to do something brave. It's like your inner engine revving up, not breaking down.\n\nAnd that fear of being judged? So many people feel that way, especially in new or high-stakes situations. It's your mind trying to protect you, but sometimes it overdoes it. You're not alone in this—I promise.\n\nWould it help to take a slow breath together? We can just pause for a moment and let that energy settle. You're doing great just by being here and talking about it.",

It makes total sense that you'd feel more comfortable in a structured environment like engineering. But here's the thing: that analytical mind of yours? It can actually be a huge asset in social situations too.\n\nThink of socializing like solving an engineering problem—you're gathering data, testing approaches, and iterating. It doesn't have to be perfect; it's about progress, not perfection. And those nerves? They're just your system's way of saying, \"Hey, this is important.\" How does reframing it that way feel?",

But here's a reframe: in engineering, when an experiment doesn't go as planned, you don't scrap the whole project, right? You learn from it. Social interactions are the same way. There's no such thing as \"wrong data\"—just feedback. Every conversation teaches you something, even if it's just what doesn't work for you.\n\nAnd \"failing completely\"? I've never seen it happen. Awkward moments? Sure. But those moments usually bond people more than perfect conversations do. Want to try a tiny experiment right now?",

The fact that you're here and willing to grow says a lot about your determination.\n\nLet’s start with something small and manageable.

One thing you’re excited to work on in the project.\n3. A simple question to ask someone else, like, “What part are you thinking of taking on?”\n\nYou don’t have to memorize a speech—just having those notes on your phone or a piece of paper can be a huge safety net.

Eye contact can feel intense, but you don’t have to stare someone down. Try focusing on the space between their eyebrows—it feels like eye contact to them, but takes the pressure off for you.\n\nWant to try one more time, this time with that trick?

That’s just your body’s way of giving you energy for the moment. It’s not a sign of weakness; it’s your system saying, “Hey, this matters to me.”\n\nAnd about not feeling “smart enough”—imposter syndrome is incredibly common in engineering. The fact that you’re even at this university means you belong there.\n\nWhat if, instead of trying to prove you’re smart, you just got curious about the other person? People love talking about themselves. A simple, “What brought you to this event?” or “What are you working on right now?” takes the pressure off you and lets them lead.",

And you don’t need a perfect answer. You can say something like, “Right now I’m exploring research opportunities in engineering—I’m really interested in [your area].” Simple, honest, and true.\n\nAlso, it’s okay to pause before answering. A brief moment to gather your thoughts can actually make you seem more thoughtful, not less confident.\n\nWant to try a quick practice?

First, let’s normalize this: *everyone* has moments like this, even the most outgoing people. It’s not a reflection of your intelligence or worth.\n\nHere’s a practical step: try preparing a few low-pressure conversation starters. Something simple like, \"Hey, how’s your day going?\" or \"What brought you to this event?\" Practice saying them out loud when you’re alone, so they feel more natural. The goal isn’t to be perfect—it’s just to get the words out. Would you be willing to try that this week, maybe with someone in one of your classes?",

But here’s the reality: most people are so wrapped up in their own thoughts that they aren’t hyper-analyzing you. In fact, many people appreciate when someone initiates a conversation—it takes pressure off them!\n\nLet’s reframe this: instead of worrying about what they *might* think, focus on being genuinely curious about them. People love talking about themselves. Ask about their major, a project they’re working on, or even something simple like their favorite study spot on campus. \n\nAnd remember: if someone does react negatively (which is rare), it says more about *them* than you. You’re not weird for wanting to connect—you’re human. Ready to give it a shot?",

Most people don’t even notice, or if they do, they understand because they’ve been there too. \n\nHere’s a trick: take a slow, deep breath before you speak. It calms your nervous system and gives you a second to gather your thoughts. And if your voice does shake? Own it lightly. You could even say, “Wow, I always get a little nervous talking to new people!”—that kind of honesty can actually make you more relatable and ease the tension.\n\nYou’re not alone in this, Gregory.

You’re showing courage by stepping out of your comfort zone, and that’s something to be proud of, regardless of the outcome. \n\nYou’ve got this.

But here’s something important to remember: most people at networking events are focused on themselves and how *they* come across, not on picking apart what you say. And honestly, a little awkwardness is human—it doesn’t make you weird, it makes you real.\n\nWould it help if we broke this down into smaller, less intimidating steps?

Think of it this way: every interaction, even the ones that feel awkward, is practice. No one becomes great at networking overnight. It’s a skill, just like engineering—you learn, adjust, and improve over time.\n\nHow about we try reframing “messing up” as “gathering data”? Every conversation teaches you something, even if it’s just what *not* to say next time. And I’ll be here to help you reflect and grow, not judge.\n\nWould you be open to trying one tiny, manageable exercise this week—something that feels almost too easy?",

If someone doesn’t respond, it says more about their situation than your worth.\n\nHow about we make this even lower stakes? Instead of aiming for a full conversation, just practice making brief, friendly eye contact and a small smile when you pass someone in the hallway or at an event. No words needed. That way, you’re building comfort with social presence without the pressure of a response.\n\nYou’re not alone in this, Gregory. Want to try that and check in with how it felt afterward?",

It takes a lot of courage to even say, \"Hey, I want to work on this.\" I want you to know that what you're feeling is completely normal—especially in college, where it can feel like everyone else has it all figured out (spoiler: they don't!).\n\nLet's start by just acknowledging that social stuff can feel overwhelming. When you say you're not sure how to start the conversation, is there a specific worry running through your mind? Like, are you afraid of saying the \"wrong\" thing, or maybe not being interesting enough?",

It's like our brain is trying so hard to be \"perfect\" that it freezes up. And that physical reaction—the fidgeting, the racing heart—that's just your body's way of trying to protect you. It's normal, and it doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you.\n\nHere's something to try: instead of aiming for a \"perfect\" conversation, what if you just focused on asking one curious question? People love talking about themselves, and it takes the pressure off you to perform. What's one go-to question you could have ready, like \"What are you working on right now?\" or \"What brought you to this event?\"",

You could say something like, \"Oh, that sounds interesting—could you tell me a bit more about that?\" or even, \"I’m not super familiar with that field—what got you into it?\"\n\nPeople generally appreciate when others show genuine interest. And if your mind does go blank, it’s okay to take a breath and say, \"Sorry, my brain just glitched for a second!\"—owning it lightly can actually make you more relatable.\n\nYou’re already thinking ahead and preparing, which shows self-awareness—that’s a strength.

Even experts started somewhere, and asking questions is a sign of intelligence and curiosity, not ignorance.\n\nYour heart pounding is just adrenaline—it’s your body getting ready for a challenge, not a sign you’re failing. What if, instead of fighting that feeling, you thanked your body for trying to help you, and then gently redirected that energy into listening? You don’t have to be the expert—you just have to be present.\n\nAnd remember: you’re an engineering student. You’re clearly smart and capable.

Think about it: if someone asked you about *your* engineering project, would you feel bothered or valued?\n\nYou could even frame it in a way that feels natural, like: “Hey, I’ve been curious about what you’re working on—would you be open to sharing a bit about it sometime?”\n\nYou’ve got this.

Acknowledging you want to grow socially is a huge first step, and I want you to know that feeling unsure or nervous at the beginning is completely normal. In fact, it means you care, and that’s a strength.\n\nLet’s start with something simple: take a slow, deep breath with me. In for four seconds… hold for four… and out for six. Just once. Good. That breath is already helping your body recognize that you’re safe, even when your mind might be sending signals that feel overwhelming.\n\nNow, tell me a little more—what’s one social situation lately where you felt that anxiety kick in?

That’s a really common fear, but here’s the reframe: most people at mixers are focused on their *own* nerves, not judging others. They’re probably worrying about what *you* think of *them*.\n\nLet’s try a small, actionable step for next time: your only goal is to make eye contact with one person and give a genuine smile.

It’s your body saying, “I’m gearing up for something important!” Let’s not fight it—let’s work with it.\n\nHere’s a quick grounding trick: press your thumb gently into your palm. It gives your nervous energy a subtle outlet and helps you feel more present.\n\nAnd if someone thinks a smile is “weird”? That says more about *their* comfort than yours. Most people will smile back—it’s a natural human reflex. Your only job is to offer the smile; their reaction is *their* journey, not yours. How does that sound?",

You surviving an awkward moment builds resilience—like lifting weights for your confidence.\n\nIf someone doesn’t smile back, it likely has nothing to do with you. Maybe they’re distracted, having a rough day, or just as nervous as you are. Your power lies in offering kindness, not controlling the response.\n\nNext time you feel that anxiety spike, try this: take another deep breath and silently say to yourself, “I am safe. This feeling is temporary.” You’ve got this, Gregory. Small steps, remember?",

Most people won’t even remember it—they’re too wrapped up in their own inner dialogue.\n\nHere’s a vocal warm-up you can do privately before events: hum softly for 30 seconds. It relaxes your vocal cords and gives you a sense of control. And if your voice does waver? Own it lightly. A small laugh or a “Whoops, got a bit excited there!” can actually make you more relatable. You’re not aiming for perfection—you’re aiming for connection. How does that land?",

Our brains are wired to protect us in social situations, and sometimes that protection looks like freezing up. It doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with you; it just means you care a lot about making a good impression and connecting meaningfully.\n\nNow, I want to highlight something about you: you’re highly extroverted and agreeable. That tells me you genuinely enjoy being around people and want to build positive connections—that’s a huge strength! Your warmth and desire to connect are assets, even if anxiety tries to mask them.\n\nHere’s a small, practical step: instead of focusing on saying the “right” thing at a networking event, try shifting your goal. Your only job for the first 10 minutes is to listen and ask one open-ended question—like, “What brought you to this",

However, the response didn't proactively address his specific worry about physical symptoms (shaking voice, blank mind) with a concrete, in-the-moment strategy. For similar students, the key insight is to pair cognitive reframing with a simple physical anchor (e.g., a grounding technique) to manage acute anxiety symptoms directly."

The racing heart, the trembling, the mental blankness—those are all common responses when our brain senses a threat, even if the “threat” is just talking to someone new.\n\nIt sounds like that inner critic is really loud in those moments, telling you others will see you as “stupid.” Have you noticed if that voice shows up in other parts of your life, like in class or when you’re working on your engineering projects?",

But when it comes to interacting with people, especially in situations where you feel evaluated, that self-doubt and anxiety take over. Am I hearing that right?\n\nIt’s completely understandable. You’re not alone in feeling this way—many people, even those who seem confident, struggle with that fear of being judged. It’s like your brain is trying to protect you from rejection, but it ends up holding you back instead.\n\nWould it be okay if we started exploring small, manageable ways to help you feel a bit more grounded in those moments—like before we even get to the networking part?",

I know it can feel awkward or vulnerable to talk about social skills, but you're definitely not alone in feeling this way. A lot of students, especially in high-pressure environments like engineering and law, experience similar challenges.\n\nLet's start slow. What's on your mind right now?

That's your body's natural response to stress, and it happens to almost everyone in situations like this. It doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you.\n\nLet's break this down: what's the scariest part for you about talking to people at the event?

But here's something important: that feeling doesn't reflect reality. People at networking events are often just as nervous, and they're usually more focused on themselves than judging you.\n\nLet's try shifting the goal from \"impressing everyone\" to something smaller and kinder to yourself. What if, for your first conversation, your only goal was to ask one person, \"What brought you to this event?\" You don't even have to talk about yourself right away.

That’s a natural stress reaction—your body is literally trying to keep you safe. It doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with you.\n\nGiven how extroverted and agreeable you are, it makes sense that you *want* to connect with people, but that fear of not measuring up holds you back.

I want you to know that it’s completely normal to feel a little uncertain, especially when you're navigating something as personal as social skills.\n\nBefore we dive into any advice, I’d love to understand a bit more about what specifically feels challenging for you socially. When you think about social situations—whether it’s meeting new people, speaking up in class, or even just casual conversations—what kinds of thoughts or feelings come up for you? And how does your body tend to react in those moments?",

          "speaker": "ai",
          "content": "Thank you for sharing that, Gregory. It sounds incredibly overwhelming when your mind goes blank and your body reacts so strongly—the sweating, the shaking. That’s your nervous system kicking into high gear, and it’s a completely natural response when you feel pressure or fear. It’s not a sign of weakness; it’s your body trying to protect you, even if it doesn’t feel helpful in the moment.\n\nIt also makes total sense that overthinking comes into play. When we’re anxious, our brain goes into overdrive trying to anticipate every possible outcome, and that can be mentally exhausting. Have you noticed if there are certain situations where this happens more—like in larger groups, one-on-ones, or when you’re talking to people in positions of authority?",

          "content": "I hear you, Gregory. It sounds like the fear of judgment—especially from people you perceive as having authority or influence, like professors or potential employers—really amplifies that anxiety. That’s a very common experience, especially for driven students like you who care deeply about doing well and making a good impression.\n\nWhen your voice feels like it disappears in those moments, it’s almost like your body is trying to protect you from perceived threat—even if the “threat” is just someone’s opinion. It’s okay to feel that way, and you’re not alone in it. Many high-achieving students struggle with this exact dynamic.\n\nGiven what you’ve shared, it sounds like building confidence in lower-pressure situations first might help ease some of that intensity. Would you be open to trying a small, manageable step that aligns with your goal of getting a research position? Something like practicing talking about your academic interests in a more controlled setting?",

          "content": "That fear of \"messing up\" even in practice is completely valid, Gregory. It shows how much you care about doing things well—especially in engineering, where precision and knowledge really matter to you. It makes sense that you’d want to protect something that’s such a big part of your identity.\n\nBut here’s something important: you don’t have to be perfect to be capable, interesting, or worthy of respect. In fact, some of the best learning and connecting happens when we allow ourselves to be human—questions, pauses, and all.\n\nSince engineering is your strength, let’s use that to your advantage. How would you feel about starting with something simple, like rehearsing a 2-minute “elevator pitch” about a project you’re passionate about—just to yourself or maybe recording it? No audience, no pressure. The goal isn’t to be flawless; it’s just to get comfortable hearing yourself talk about what you love",

That’s just nervous energy trying to find a way out. It’s okay. Let it be there.\n\nHere’s a reframe: you don’t have to sound like a charismatic speaker right away. You just have to sound like *you*—someone who’s genuinely excited about bridge design. Engineers appreciate clarity and passion, not performative charm.\n\nTry this: when you practice, imagine you’re explaining your project to a friend who’s curious but doesn’t know the technical details. Use phrases like, “What’s really cool about this part is…” or “I ran into a challenge with X, but here’s how we worked around it…” It makes the conversation feel more human, less like a presentation.\n\nWould you be willing to try that",
