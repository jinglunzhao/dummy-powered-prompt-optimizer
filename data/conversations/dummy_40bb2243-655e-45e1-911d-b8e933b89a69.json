Starting conversations can feel overwhelming, especially when you're working on social skills, so let's take it slow and make this a comfortable space for you.\n\nFirst, tell me a little about what specific situations make you feel the most anxious. Is it starting conversations, speaking in groups, or something else? We can break it down together and come up with small, manageable steps to practice.

The fear of judgment can be so overwhelming—I've been there too, and it's tough.\n\nLet's try something simple to start: next time you're in a group, maybe just focus on one person at a time. You don't have to say a lot—even a small comment or a question can help. For example, you could ask someone about a class or mention something you noticed. Would you feel comfortable trying that?",

And honestly, asking a simple question—like \"What did you think of the lecture?\" or \"How are you finding this class?\"—is a great way to start. It shows you're engaged and friendly, and it's unlikely anyone would see that as \"stupid.\"\n\nAlso, if you feel your breath getting shallow, try this: take a slow, quiet breath in through your nose for 4 seconds, hold for 2, then exhale slowly through your mouth for 6 seconds. It can help calm your nerves without anyone noticing. Want to practice that breathing with me now?",

It's completely okay to feel that way—lots of people do, even if they don't show it.\n\nFor group projects, would you like to try a small strategy? Maybe you could prepare one or two ideas beforehand and write them down. That way, even if your mind goes blank, you have something to refer to. And remember, it's okay to take a breath and say, \"Let me think about that for a moment.\" People usually respect that.\n\nAs for office hours, would it help if we practiced what you might say? For example, something simple like, \"Hi, I'm Sarah from your Math class. I had a question about...\" We can role-play it if you're comfortable. How does that sound?",

Maybe you could even start by jotting down a few phrases you might use, like, \"I was thinking we could try...\" or \"What if we approached it this way?\" Having those notes with you during group work can be a little safety net.\n\nAnd for office hours, maybe just visualizing it could help? Picture yourself walking in, taking a deep breath, and saying one simple sentence. You don't have to do it perfectly—just showing up is a huge win.\n\nHow does focusing on the note-taking idea feel for now? We can come back to role-playing another time if you ever want to.",

But here's something important to remember: study groups are meant for asking questions—even the ones you might think are \"stupid.\" In reality, others probably have the same question or admire your courage for speaking up.\n\nLet's try a small exercise together: next time you're in a group, maybe you could prepare one question ahead of time and practice saying it quietly to yourself. Or, if speaking up feels too overwhelming, you could try writing it down and passing a note or asking someone after the group. What do you think about starting with something like that?",

And honestly, in a study group, people are usually focused on learning and helping each other, not judging. If someone does react negatively (which is rare), that says more about them than about you or your question.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind: sometimes what feels like a \"dumb question\" to us is actually something others are wondering too. You might even be helping someone else who was too shy to ask. How does that perspective feel to you?",

But here’s something to remember: most people at networking events feel a little nervous too, even if they don’t show it.\n\nLet’s try reframing it: instead of worrying about sounding impressive, what if you focused on just being curious? For example, when someone asks what you study, you could say, “I’m studying math—I love how it feels like solving puzzles. What about you?” That shifts the focus and gives the other person a chance to talk too.\n\nAs for approaching people first—that’s tough, I know. Would you like to practice a simple opener together?

If someone stares or seems unresponsive, it’s almost never about you—they might be distracted, shy, or just having an off day.\n\nAnd that opener isn’t stupid at all—it’s friendly and relatable! If someone reacts awkwardly, you can always follow up with something like, “I guess these events can feel a little overwhelming, right?” That shows empathy and might help both of you relax.\n\nWould it help if we role-played it a bit?

First off, it's okay to feel nervous—a lot of people do, even if they don't show it.\n\nOne thing that might help is preparing a little beforehand. For example, you could jot down a couple of points you want to bring up in the discussion. That way, even if you feel flustered, you have something to fall back on. Also, remember that your teammates are likely focused on the task, not on judging you.

Plus, it's a collaborative question, so it encourages everyone to participate.\n\nHow does planning that one line in advance sound?

You don’t have to have everything figured out right now.\n\nSince you mentioned wanting to improve socially, especially in new environments, maybe we can start with something small and manageable. For example, have you tried striking up a conversation with just one person in your classes or study groups? Even something simple like asking about an assignment or sharing a quick observation can help ease into social interactions.\n\nAlso, I noticed you’re interested in learning about different cultures and languages—that’s awesome! Maybe joining a cultural club or language exchange group could be a low-pressure way to meet people who share your interests. You’d already have something in common to talk about!\n\nHow does that sound? And remember, it’s okay to feel nervous—",

The fact that you tried is what really matters, and I’m proud of you for that.\n\nMaybe we can try something even smaller next time? Like smiling at someone you recognize from class, or just saying “hi” as you’re walking out. You don’t have to jump into a full conversation right away. Small steps build confidence over time.\n\nAnd about clubs—I get it. Big groups can feel intimidating. What if you started by checking out a club’s social media page or attending an online event first? That way, you can get a feel for the group without the pressure of being in a crowded room.\n\nWould you be open to trying something like that?",

And online events are a fantastic way to dip your toes in without feeling overwhelmed.\n\nWhen you do try an online event, maybe set a small goal for yourself, like just listening in or typing one comment in the chat. You don’t have to speak up right away if you’re not ready. Every little bit counts.\n\nAnd remember, you’re not alone in feeling this way. A lot of students are navigating similar challenges, especially in their first year. You’re doing better than you think.\n\nWould you like help finding a low-key online event or club related to languages or cultures? I’d be happy to look with you!",

You can just listen, read along, and chime in when you feel comfortable, even if it’s just typing a short message.\n\nLet’s look for something low-key together. How about checking out your university’s virtual clubs or even platforms like Goodreads or Discord? There are often small, welcoming book groups centered around specific genres, cultures, or even language learning.\n\nWould you like help narrowing it down? Maybe we can search for clubs focused on books from cultures you’re curious about, or even bilingual book discussions if you’re interested in practicing a new language.

It’s totally normal to worry about how others might perceive you, especially when you’re in a new environment or surrounded by people who seem confident. But here’s the thing: almost everyone in that study group has probably had the exact same thought at some point—they just might not show it.\n\nOne thing that helps is to remember that study groups are meant for asking questions, even the ones that feel “silly.” In fact, asking can actually help others who might be wondering the same thing but are too nervous to speak up.\n\nWould you be open to trying a small exercise next time? Maybe prepare one question ahead of time and tell yourself, “I’m just going to ask this one thing.” You could even practice saying it out loud when you’re alone. How does that sound?",

You could even keep a small notebook or your phone handy during study group—lots of people do that.\n\nAnd if you do feel yourself starting to panic, try taking one slow, deep breath before you speak. It can help calm your nerves just enough to get the words out.\n\nRemember, it’s okay if your voice shakes or if it doesn’t come out perfectly. The courage is in trying, not in being perfect.

When you're at a networking event, what do you usually think about right before approaching someone or when you're standing alone?",

That fear of coming across as “weird” or “boring” is something a lot of people struggle with, especially when they’re in a new or high-pressure environment.\n\nOne thing that might help is to shift your focus from “What do they think of me?” to “What can I learn about them?” People generally love talking about themselves, so having a couple of simple, open-ended questions ready can take the pressure off you to be interesting. Something like, “What brought you to this event?” or “What are you studying or working on right now?” can be a great start. Would you be open to trying that next time, even just with one person?",

          "content": "That’s a really good point—silence can feel super awkward, especially when you’re already anxious. It helps to remember that pauses are normal in conversations, and most people don’t mind them as much as we think they do.\n\nOne trick is to have a few follow-up questions ready. For example, if someone says they’re studying law, you could ask, “What area of law interests you the most?” or “What got you interested in that?” You could also share a little bit about yourself—like mentioning you’re studying math and asking if they’ve ever taken a stats class or something related. It doesn’t have to be profound; just keeping the exchange going gently.\n\nAnd if there’s a lull, it’s okay to smile and say, “Well, it was really nice chatting with you!” before moving on. You don’t have to make every conversation long or deep. How does that sound?",

People usually appreciate when someone shows genuine interest.\n\nTo avoid it feeling like an interrogation, you can balance questions with small, relatable comments. For example, after they answer, you might say something like, “Oh, that’s really interesting—I’ve always wondered about that,” or even share a tiny piece of your own experience if it feels natural. It makes the conversation feel more like a two-way exchange rather than an interview.\n\nAlso, pay attention to their tone and body language. If they seem engaged and keep talking, you’re doing great. If they give short answers and seem distracted, it might not be about you—they could just be tired or in a hurry.\n\nWould it help to practice one of these exchanges with me now, just to build a little confidence?",
