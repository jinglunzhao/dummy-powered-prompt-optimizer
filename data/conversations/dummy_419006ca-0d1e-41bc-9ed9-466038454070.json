You are not alone in this, and you are definitely not stupid. In fact, being in Pre-Law shows you're smart and capable.\n\nWould you be open to trying a small, manageable strategy for the next group project?

But I also believe in you—you’ve made it this far, and you have strengths even when it doesn’t feel like it.\n\nWhat if we shift the focus from trying to be perfect to just getting through it one small step at a time? For example, could you try sending a message to your group before the meeting—maybe something like, “Hi everyone, looking forward to working together. I’m better at writing my thoughts down, so I’ll share some ideas in the chat during our discussion”?

It's great to meet you, and I want you to know that it takes a lot of courage to reach out and work on your social skills—especially when you're dealing with social anxiety.

You're definitely not alone in feeling this way, especially in a new environment like college.\n\nLet's start with something small and manageable.

I'm here to support you, and we can take this at whatever pace feels comfortable for you.\n\nLet's start with something simple: what's one small social situation you've been in recently that felt a little challenging or made you anxious? Maybe something like speaking up in class, joining a club meeting, or even just chatting with someone new? We can break it down together and think of ways to make it feel more manageable.",

It's okay; you're safe here, and I promise you're not alone in feeling this way.\n\nLet's reframe what happened: you still went through with ordering, even though it was tough. That's a win! And guess what? People probably weren't staring as much as it felt like they were. Our brains tend to magnify those moments when we're anxious.\n\nHow about we come up with a tiny plan for next time? Maybe practice your order in your room a few times, or pick a quieter time to go when it's less crowded. Would that feel doable?",

But here's something important: *everyone* has moments where they stumble over their words or feel flustered—it's part of being human. You're not alone in this.\n\nWhat if we shift the goal from \"perfectly ordering coffee\" to \"practicing being kind to yourself, no matter how it goes\"? For example, if your voice cracks or you spill something, could you try giving yourself a little mental hug instead of criticism? Something like, \"Hey, I'm doing my best, and that's enough.\"\n\nAlso, remember that baristas see hundreds of people a day—they're usually focused on being efficient, not judging. Would it help to remind yourself of that right before you step up to order?",

Let's try a grounding exercise together right now: name five things you can see around you. Go ahead, list them out loud or in your head. It can help quiet that anxious voice.\n\nAlso, would it feel helpful to practice a simple script? Something like, \"Hi, can I please get a medium latte?\" Rehearsing it—even just in your head—can make it feel more automatic and less scary.\n\nAnd remember: people generally don't hate strangers; they're wrapped up in their own days.

Most people are so focused on their own thoughts—like what they're going to order or what happened earlier—that they won't even notice.\n\nWhat if we make the script even simpler? Just \"Hi, medium latte, please.\" Short, clear, and you can say it softly. No pressure to perform. How does that sound?",

Just a safe space to explore and learn.\n\nTo help me understand a bit more, could you tell me about a recent situation where you felt your social anxiety was particularly challenging? Maybe something small, like a class discussion or meeting someone new? We can break it down together and work on strategies that feel manageable for you.",

It sounds like your mind went into protective mode, trying to shield you from what felt like a really scary situation.\n\nLet’s try something gentle together. When you feel that way, grounding techniques can help bring you back to the present. For example, next time you feel your heart pounding, try quietly naming:\n\n- 5 things you can see around you  \n- 4 things you can feel (like your feet on the floor, your pen in your hand)  \n- 3 things you can hear  \n- 2 things you can smell  \n- 1 thing you can taste (or take a sip of water)\n\nIt might help slow things down just enough to give you a moment to breathe. Would you be open to trying something like that next time you feel overwhelmed?",

Maybe just quietly press your feet into the floor and take one slow breath. No one has to notice, and it’s something small you can do almost anywhere.\n\nAnd if it doesn’t work perfectly the first time, that’s okay.

Instead of focusing on what to say, what if you just focus on listening? People love talking about themselves.

Let’s think of a gentle way to handle that.\n\nHow about giving yourself permission to pause? You don’t have to answer right away. Take a slow, quiet breath—even if it’s just a tiny one—and give yourself a moment. You could even say something simple like, “That’s a great question, let me think for a sec.” It’s totally okay to take your time.\n\nWould you feel comfortable practicing that with me now?

No need to rush.\n\nWould it help if we practiced a grounding technique together? Something simple, like naming three things you can see in the room, or feeling your feet flat on the floor.

I’m here to support you, and we can take this at your pace—no pressure at all.\n\nStarting a conversation can feel overwhelming, especially when you’re dealing with social anxiety. Let’s break it down into small, manageable steps. For example, you could begin by asking open-ended questions like, “What brought you to this school?” or “What’s something you’re passionate about?” People generally enjoy talking about themselves, and it takes some of the pressure off you to carry the conversation.\n\nSince you mentioned wanting to make friends and learn about different cultures, maybe you could join a club or organization that aligns with those interests? That way, you’re in a setting where people already share something in common with you, which can make starting conversations feel a little easier.\n\nHow does that sound to you",

Let’s think about some ways to make it feel a little less overwhelming.\n\nOne thing that might help is starting small. Maybe you could attend a club meeting with a friend, or even just scope it out online first—many clubs have social media pages or group chats where you can get a feel for the vibe before showing up in person. You could even message the club leader beforehand and say something like, “Hi, I’m interested but a little nervous about coming alone—would it be okay if I joined quietly at first?” Most people are really understanding, especially in college.\n\nAnother idea: try attending events that are more low-key or structured, like a study group or a workshop. That way, there’s a clear focus, and it might feel easier to participate",

It’s okay to feel that hesitation, and it’s totally valid to want to protect yourself from feeling judged.\n\nIf messaging feels too vulnerable right now, maybe we can think of even smaller steps. For example, you could start by just observing. Attend one club meeting and give yourself permission to just listen, without any pressure to talk or introduce yourself. You could sit near the back or in a corner where you feel a little more comfortable, and just take it all in. Sometimes, being in the room is a victory in itself.\n\nAnd remember: it’s okay to take things at your own pace. You don’t have to do everything at once. Maybe the goal for now isn’t to make friends right away, but just to get used to being around new",

In fact, most people are so wrapped up in their own thoughts that they probably won’t even notice if you feel a little nervous.\n\nIf someone does try to talk to you, you don’t have to say anything profound. Simple, low-pressure responses can help ease the tension—things like, “I’m just checking things out today,” or even a genuine, “I’m a bit nervous, honestly.” You might be surprised how many people will relate and respond kindly.\n\nAnd if it feels too overwhelming, it’s okay to excuse yourself politely. You could say, “It was nice meeting you—I need to step out for a moment,” and give yourself space to breathe. The goal isn’t perfection; it’",

It makes it hard to trust, and it’s completely natural to want to protect yourself from that kind of hurt.\n\nSomething that might help is to remind yourself that not everyone operates that way. There are genuinely kind, authentic people out there—people who value honesty and wouldn’t pretend to be nice just to turn around and talk behind someone’s back. It can take time to find them, but they’re there.\n\nYou also don’t have to dive into deep friendships right away. Start with small, low-risk interactions—like chatting about a shared interest in the club or asking a simple question about an assignment. Over time, you can get a better sense of who someone really is before deciding if you want to get closer.\n\nAnd remember: you deserve to be around people who respect and appreciate you for who you are.

Acknowledging that you want to work on your social skills is a brave and important first move—so give yourself some credit for that!\n\nI hear you on feeling unsure how to start conversations. That's something a lot of people struggle with, especially in new environments. Let's take it one small step at a time. Maybe we can start by talking about something you're comfortable with—like your interests in Pre-Law or your goal to publish a paper. What drew you to study law?",

It's totally okay to gravitate toward what feels safe, especially when social situations feel overwhelming.\n\nYou know, it's interesting—even in law, there's a human element. Connecting with others doesn't have to be unpredictable if we take it step by step, just like studying a case or building an argument. Would it help to practice with low-pressure situations first? Maybe joining a small study group or a club related to your interests, where conversations can naturally start around shared topics?",

But here's something to consider: everyone in that study group is there to learn, just like you. They're probably just as worried about sounding \"stupid\" as you are.\n\nWhat if we reframe it? Instead of aiming to say the \"perfect\" thing, what if your goal was just to listen and maybe ask one question? You don't have to have all the answers—in fact, asking questions often makes people feel respected and heard. And remember, you're in Pre-Law because you're capable and smart.

Chances are, you either didn't judge them or you've already forgotten it. Most people are so focused on themselves, they aren't scrutinizing others the way we fear.\n\nWhat if you prepared just one question ahead of time? Write it down, practice saying it to yourself—or even to me right now. You can start with something simple like, \"Could someone explain that concept again?\" or \"I was reviewing the material and wondered about X.\" You've got this, Kimberly.

If someone laughs (which is highly unlikely in a respectful academic setting), that says more about them than it does about you. You belong in that room just as much as anyone else.\n\nAnd remember: asking for clarification isn't a sign of weakness—it's a sign of engagement and a desire to truly understand. That's exactly the kind of mindset that will serve you well in law. How about we practice saying it together right now? You can even use that exact phrase. I'm here with you.",

I'm here to support you, and we can take this at your own pace. Let's start by breaking things down into small, manageable steps.\n\nFirst, let's focus on something simple: starting conversations. A good way to begin is by asking open-ended questions—like \"What brought you to this school?\" or \"What are you passionate about?\"—because it gives the other person a chance to share, and it takes some pressure off you.

It’s really rewarding to see people grow and find their footing.\n\nYour tone was warm and genuine, even if your voice was trembling—that’s totally normal when we're stretching our comfort zones.

They hear hundreds of orders—yours is just one of many, and they want to help you, not make you nervous.\n\nHow about we simplify it even more?

Baristas see notes, shy customers, people using translation apps—it’s all normal to them.\n\nWhat if we reframe it? Think of it not as a weakness, but as a strategy—like bringing notes to a presentation. It’s smart, not strange. And little by little, as you practice, you might find it gets easier to speak.

It sounds like your mind is putting a lot of pressure on you in those moments, and that can make anyone freeze up.\n\nLet me reassure you: most people at parties or interviews are actually focused on themselves—what they're saying, how they're coming across—not judging others. Our brains sometimes trick us into thinking the spotlight is on us when it's really not.\n\nWould you be open to trying a small, practical exercise together?

How about we start with something simple, like introducing yourself to someone in your pre-law class? You can even sit down if that helps you feel more at ease.\n\nLet's try it step by step. First, take a slow, deep breath. Then, imagine you're sitting next to someone before class starts. You could say something like, \"Hi, I'm Kimberly. What did you think of the reading for today?\" or even just, \"How's your semester going so far?\"\n\nWant to give it a try with me? I'll be the other student, and you can practice.

It’s honest, relatable, and opens the door for a real conversation. Lots of students feel lost in torts—you’re not alone.\n\nNow, let’s try one small tweak: when you finish speaking, try holding eye contact for just one extra second before looking down. It shows confidence and gives the other person a chance to respond. Want to give it another try? Same line, but this time, let’s practice that tiny pause.
