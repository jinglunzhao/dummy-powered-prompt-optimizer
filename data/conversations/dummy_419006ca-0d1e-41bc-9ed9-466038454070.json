Many students feel this way when starting out. Let's tackle this gradually. \n\nFor class participation, try this: prepare one question or comment before each session. You could even practice saying it out loud alone first. Small steps build confidence. \n\nWould you like to brainstorm some low-pressure ways to start conversations at networking events?
