This leverages your openness to learn from others naturally. \n\n2) For interviews, prepare 3 concise \"story nuggets\" about your projects (your political science background gives you strong narrative skills). Practice them casually with classmates first. \n\nRemember, imposter syndrome often means you're growing.

That way, you can get comfortable with your material before the big moment. And remember, even those \"confident\" people probably get nervous too—they’ve just learned to channel it.  \n\nAs for networking, if you're worried about coming off too aggressive, focus on being genuinely curious about others.

Instead of jumping straight into “Here’s what I want,” try asking questions like, “What’s something you wish you’d known when you were in my shoes?” People love sharing advice, and it takes the pressure off you to perform. \n\nFor freezing up, prep a few go-to stories—like that group project where you nailed the presentation",

Since you mentioned you sometimes come off too aggressive when nervous, let’s break this down into smaller, more manageable steps.  \n\nFirst, try shifting your mindset from \"I need to impress everyone\" to \"I’m here to learn and connect.\" This can ease the pressure. A simple trick is to prepare a few open-ended questions beforehand, like *\"What’s been your favorite project you’ve worked on?\"* or *\"How did you get started in this field?\"* People love talking about themselves, and this takes the spotlight off you while still building rapport.  \n\nAlso, pay attention to your",

You don’t have to work a whole room at once. Try targeting 1-2 people per event to connect with genuinely—ask about their projects or share a relatable struggle (like, “I’m still figuring out how to sound smart when people ask about my research”).

The fact that you’re aware of coming off too aggressive means you’re halfway to fixing it; most people don’t even realize their own tone!  \n\nHere’s a tiny tweak that might help: Instead of diving straight into your accomplishments at career fairs, try leading with curiosity. Ask *them* questions first—like, “What’s something you wish students knew about your field?” or “What’s the most rewarding project you’ve worked on?” It shifts the dynamic from “selling yourself” to building a genuine connection.
