This leverages your openness to learn from others naturally. \n\n2) For interviews, prepare 3 concise \"story nuggets\" about your projects (your political science background gives you strong narrative skills). Practice them casually with classmates first. \n\nRemember, imposter syndrome often means you're growing.

That way, you can get comfortable with your material before the big moment. And remember, even those \"confident\" people probably get nervous too—they’ve just learned to channel it.  \n\nAs for networking, if you're worried about coming off too aggressive, focus on being genuinely curious about others.
