Acknowledging that you want to work on your social skills is a huge first move, and it shows real self-awareness and courage—especially when dealing with social anxiety. I'm here to support you, not judge you, so let's take this at your pace.\n\nSince you're studying Communications, it's awesome that you're already building skills that align with your interests! Let's start with something small and manageable. What's one social situation you'd like to feel more comfortable in? Maybe something like speaking up in class, joining a club, or even just chatting with classmates?",

It's okay to feel nervous, and it's great that you're identifying exactly what's challenging for you. Let's break it down together.\n\nOne thing that might help is having a few \"go-to\" questions or topics ready. For example, you could ask about a class assignment, a shared interest (like art, since you're at the Art Academy), or even something simple like, \"How's your week going?\" Would you feel comfortable trying that out with just one person this week, maybe before or after class?",

Most people appreciate when someone shows interest or reaches out—it can even make their day! Plus, asking about an assignment is a natural and relevant topic since you're both in the same class.\n\nIf it helps, you could frame it in a way that feels low-pressure, like, \"Hey, I was a bit confused about that project—did you have any thoughts on it?\" That way, it's collaborative and not just small talk.

Starting a conversation about something you're working on, especially when it feels vulnerable, takes a lot of courage. I'm here to help, and we can take this at whatever pace feels comfortable for you.\n\nLet's start with something simple: what's one social situation you've been in recently that you found challenging, or maybe even one you're looking forward to but feel a little nervous about?",

That’s a really common experience, and it’s okay to feel that way.\n\nOne thing that might help is preparing a little beforehand. For example, before your next group meeting, you could jot down a couple of ideas or questions you want to bring up. That way, even if you feel stuck in the moment, you have something to fall back on. Would you be open to trying something like that?",

But here’s something to keep in mind: your perspective is valuable, and your classmates are probably just as focused on their own contributions as they are on judging yours.\n\nOne thing that helps me is remembering that everyone brings something unique to the table. Even if an idea doesn’t end up being used, sharing it can spark a conversation or lead to a better solution. And honestly, most people are more supportive than we give them credit for.\n\nWould it help to practice sharing an idea with me right now, just to get comfortable putting it out there?

Progress isn’t about being flawless; it’s about trying, learning, and trying again.\n\nIf breathing exercises haven’t clicked for you, that’s totally fine—they’re not for everyone. Maybe something more tactile would help, like holding a small object (a pen, a stress ball) to focus on, or even silently repeating a calming phrase to yourself before you speak.

It’s okay to feel that way—lots of people do, even if they don’t show it.\n\nHere’s a practical idea: try preparing a little before the group meets.

Would you feel comfortable trying that for your next group meeting?",

But here’s the thing: your ideas are valuable, and they’re part of what makes group work so powerful—everyone brings something different to the table.\n\nOne thing that might help is reframing how you see your contributions. Instead of thinking, \"What if this is stupid?\", try asking yourself, \"What’s one small thing I can add to help the group move forward?\" Even something like, \"Should we start by outlining the project steps?\" can be really helpful and is hard for anyone to criticize.\n\nAlso, remember: most people are so focused on their own contributions (and their own insecurities!) that they aren’t judging yours as harshly as you might think.

Asking about the outline is a great way to contribute without putting too much pressure on yourself—it shows you’re engaged and thinking ahead.\n\nAbout the shaky voice: that’s your body’s natural response to anxiety, and it happens to a lot of people (even experienced speakers!). Here’s a little trick: before you speak, take a quiet, deep breath and exhale slowly. It can help calm your nerves just enough to steady your voice. You could even practice saying your question out loud a couple times when you’re alone, just to get comfortable with how it sounds.\n\nWould you like to try rehearsing that question with me right now?

The fact that you pushed through even when it felt uncomfortable shows real courage.\n\nSomething that might help: try speaking just a tiny bit slower and grounding your feet firmly on the floor. It can make your voice feel and sound more steady. And remember—people are generally more focused on the content of what you’re saying than how your voice sounds in the moment.\n\nYou’re doing great just by practicing.
