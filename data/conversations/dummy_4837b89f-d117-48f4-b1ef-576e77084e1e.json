First, major props for recognizing this challenge—that's already step one. Since you're comfortable online, use that as your training ground: try joining virtual networking events or club meetings where you can practice speaking with cameras off at first. For in-person situations, start small—maybe chat with one classmate before/after lectures. And remember, most people in group projects are just as nervous as you are! Would you like to brainstorm some low-pressure leadership opportunities (like organizing an online event) to build confidence gradually?",

For social anxiety, start small—try saying hi to one new person daily or asking a classmate about an assignment. For public speaking, practice with friends or record yourself to build confidence. \n\nFor study habits, try the Pomodoro technique (25-min focused sessions) and use a planner to tackle deadlines before they feel overwhelming. Leadership will come as you get more comfortable speaking up—maybe join a low-pressure club first. \n\nYou've got this! Small steps lead to big progress.

Since you're naturally outgoing (that extraversion is a superpower!), let's start small with your comfort zone: try striking up 1 casual convo daily with classmates before/after lectures. These low-stakes interactions build confidence naturally. For public speaking, practice your presentations alone first, then record yourself—it's less intimidating than live audiences.

Then, try speaking up in low-pressure settings (like study groups). Leadership can grow from there—maybe take on a small role in a club project.  \n\nDeadlines stressing you?

Instead of diving into networking events, try low-stakes practice—like chatting with the barista for an extra 10 seconds or asking a classmate about an assignment. The goal isn’t to be \"perfect,\" just to build comfort with tiny interactions.  \n\nFor grad school interviews: Mock interviews with a trusted friend or mentor can help.
