You can leave anytime. \n\n2) For the student org idea - would you feel comfortable first discussing it with just one supportive professor? \n\nYour conscientious nature means you'll prepare well, and your openness will help you adapt. Many grad students feel this way - you're not alone. \n\nWould either of these micro-steps feel manageable to try before we meet again?",

Warm validation (\"small is everything\") reinforced safety.\n\n**What could improve:**  \nProactively address sustainability earlier—e.g., suggest a post-event decompression ritual to prevent burnout. Gently explore the root fear behind \"figuring out what to say next\" when she raised it.\n\n**Key insight for similar students:**  \nAnxiety-sensitive coaching thrives when pairing *concrete behavioral scripts* (e.g., the planned question) with *immediate reward framing* (\"walking through the door is the win\"). Always embed recovery strategies."

Maybe something low-pressure, like connecting with just one person on LinkedIn from a field you're interested in, or attending a virtual career event where you can just listen at first? Breaking it down into tiny steps makes it feel less daunting. \n\nAlso, about speaking up in class—would it help to prepare one comment or question beforehand?
