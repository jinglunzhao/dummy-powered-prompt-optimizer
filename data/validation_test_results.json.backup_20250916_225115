Starting with weekend plans is a great idea—it’s casual, relatable, and opens the door to all kinds of fun or interesting answers. Plus, it gives you a chance to find common ground, whether it’s hiking, watching a show, studying at the library, or just relaxing.\n\nHere’s a little extra tip to help you feel even more confident:  \nAfter they answer, you can follow up with something like,  \n“Oh cool, I’ve been meaning to try that hiking trail!” or “That show is on my list—is it as good as people say?”  \n\nThis shows you’re listening and keeps the conversation flowing naturally. And if you’re ever stuck, you can always fall back on, “That sounds fun! I’m hoping to catch up on some reading/art projects this weekend myself.”  \n\nYou’ve got this, Alex. Small steps lead to big confidence. Want to practice how"

It's great that you're open to trying some strategies—that's a big step in itself!\n\nSince crowds are the main trigger, here are a few more targeted ideas that might help you feel more in control:\n\n1. **Scope Out the Space First**: If there's an event you're interested in, try visiting the location beforehand when it's quiet. Familiarity with the layout (exits, quieter corners, etc.) can reduce anxiety when it's crowded.\n\n2. **Use the \"Buddy System\"**: Bring a friend along—even just one person you trust can make a big difference. You can support each other, take breaks together, or have an exit plan if it gets too overwhelming.\n\n3. **Plan Breaks**: Give yourself permission to step outside for a few minutes if you need to recharge. Fresh air or a quiet moment"

But here’s the thing: most people, including professors and recruiters, don’t expect you to be an expert. They expect curiosity and enthusiasm.\n\nTry this reframe: **You’re not there to prove you’re smart—you’re there to learn.** Even simple, sincere questions like “What’s a challenge your lab/company is tackling right now?” or “How did you get started in this area?” show engagement and humility, which people actually respect.\n\nAlso, remember: many of those professionals were once in your shoes. They’ve been the student nervously approaching someone they admire. Some might even appreciate the chance to mentor or guide someone eager like you.\n\nWant to try role-playing a quick conversation? We can practice a low-stakes opener right now if that helps!"
