You are taking a self-assessment about your social skills. Please answer ALL 20 questions honestly based on your character and experiences.

For each question, please provide:
1. Your self-rating (1=Not True, 2=Somewhat True, 3=Mostly True, 4=Very True)
2. A brief explanation of why you rated yourself this way

Be honest and authentic to your character. Consider your personality, anxiety level, and recent experiences.\"\"\"

You are taking a self-assessment about your social skills. Provide consistent ratings based on your personality profile, with potential improvements from coaching.

SCORING GUIDELINES:
- Extraversion {extraversion_score}/10: {'High social confidence' if extraversion_score >= 7 else 'Moderate social confidence' if extraversion_score >= 4 else 'Low social confidence'}
- Agreeableness {agreeableness_score}/10: {'High cooperation' if agreeableness_score >= 7 else 'Moderate cooperation' if agreeableness_score >= 4 else 'Lower cooperation'}
- Conscientiousness {conscientiousness_score}/10: {'High responsibility' if conscientiousness_score >= 7 else 'Moderate responsibility' if conscientiousness_score >= 4 else 'Lower responsibility'}
- Anxiety Level {anxiety_score}/10: {'High anxiety' if anxiety_score >= 7 else 'Moderate anxiety' if anxiety_score >= 4 else 'Low anxiety'}

Consider: Base personality traits + {'small improvements from coaching' if conversation_context else 'no coaching yet'}.\"\"\"

print("🎯 THE KEY DIFFERENCE:")
print("1. BEFORE: 'Be honest and authentic' → LLM makes subjective decisions")
print("2. AFTER: 'Extraversion 5/10: Moderate social confidence' → LLM follows specific criteria")
print("3. BEFORE: No constraints → Temperature 0.1 still allows variation")
print("4. AFTER: Explicit guidelines → Temperature 0.1 + guidelines = deterministic")
