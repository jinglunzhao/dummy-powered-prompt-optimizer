print("\n‚ùå OLD PROMPT ISSUES:")
print("1. Vague instruction: 'Be honest and authentic to your character'")
print("2. No specific scoring criteria")
print("3. Relies on LLM interpretation of 'Balanced' personality")
print("4. Allows subjective 'authentic' responses")
print("5. No deterministic mapping to scores")

print("\n‚úÖ NEW PROMPT IMPROVEMENTS:")
print("1. Explicit scoring guidelines with specific ranges")
print("2. Clear personality-to-score mapping")
print("3. Deterministic criteria (5/10 = Moderate)")
print("4. Structured format requirements")
print("5. Objective scoring based on traits")

print("\nüéØ WHY THIS ACHIEVES CONSISTENCY:")
print("1. OLD: LLM interprets 'Balanced' ‚Üí Could be 2, 2.5, 3, or 3.5")
print("2. NEW: LLM sees '5/10: Moderate' ‚Üí Always chooses 2-3 range")
print("3. OLD: Subjective 'authentic' ‚Üí Random variation")
print("4. NEW: Objective 'based on personality' ‚Üí Deterministic")
print("5. OLD: No constraints ‚Üí High temperature causes variation")
print("6. NEW: Clear constraints ‚Üí Low temperature + guidelines = consistent")

print("We now ask: 'Based on your 5/10 extraversion (moderate social confidence),")
print("rate your help-seeking behavior.'")
print("\nThis gives the LLM a SPECIFIC CRITERION to follow, not a SUBJECTIVE FEELING.")
